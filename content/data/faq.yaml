# RangeFit Frequently Asked Questions
faq:
  - id: need-cgm
    question: "Do I need a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) to use RangeFit?"
    answer: |
      No! While you can input glucose readings if you have them, our AI is designed to work
      just as well by learning from your self-reported energy levels, workout performance,
      and daily feelings. This makes it a powerful and affordable alternative to expensive CGM-based apps.

  - id: for-beginners
    question: "I'm a complete beginner to exercise. Is this for me?"
    answer: |
      Absolutely. RangeFit is designed for the 'Everyman', not elite athletes. Workouts are
      simple, require no gym, and can be adjusted to any fitness level. Our goal is progress,
      not perfection.

  - id: for-my-condition
    question: "Does this work for PCOS, Pre-diabetes, or Type 2 Diabetes?"
    answer: |
      Yes. The core principles of glucose-aware fitness benefit anyone managing insulin
      resistance, which is a key factor in all these conditions. Our AI adapts to *your*
      body's unique patterns, regardless of the specific diagnosis.

  - id: different-from-others
    question: "How is this different from MyFitnessPal or Peloton?"
    answer: |
      Those are great apps, but they are 'glucose-unaware'. They don't adapt your exercise
      based on how it impacts your blood sugar and energy. RangeFit's AI is specifically
      designed to find workouts that give you stable energy all day, which is a game-changer.

  - id: lose-weight
    question: "Will I lose weight with RangeFit?"
    answer: |
      Many of our members do lose weight, but our primary goal is to help you feel more
      energized and in control. Weight loss is often a happy side effect of stabilizing
      your blood sugar and building a consistent fitness habit.

  - id: time-commitment
    question: "How much time does it take?"
    answer: |
      Our plans are designed for busy lives. Most workouts are just 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times
      per week. We believe consistency is more important than intensity.

  - id: equipment-needed
    question: "What equipment do I need?"
    answer: |
      None! All our workouts are designed to be done at home with just your body weight.
      As you progress, you might want to add simple items like resistance bands or light
      dumbbells, but they're completely optional.

  - id: how-ai-works
    question: "How does the AI personalize my plan?"
    answer: |
      Our AI learns from the data you provide - your energy levels, how you felt after workouts,
      and any glucose readings if you have them. It identifies patterns unique to your body and
      adjusts your exercise timing, intensity, and type to optimize for stable energy and blood sugar.

  - id: data-privacy
    question: "Is my health data private and secure?"
    answer: |
      Absolutely. We take data privacy seriously. Your health information is encrypted, never
      sold to third parties, and you can delete your account and all data at any time. We're
      HIPAA-aware and follow best practices for health data security.

  - id: free-plan-limits
    question: "What's included in the free plan?"
    answer: |
      The free 7-day plan includes 3 glucose-stabilizing workouts, an exercise timing guide,
      and an energy tracking sheet. It's a complete introduction to glucose-aware fitness
      with no strings attached - no credit card required!

  - id: when-see-results
    question: "How soon will I see results?"
    answer: |
      Most people notice more stable energy within the first week. Blood sugar improvements
      can be seen within 2-3 weeks with consistent effort. Long-term metabolic changes typically
      take 8-12 weeks, but you'll feel the difference much sooner.

  - id: medical-advice
    question: "Is this medical advice? Should I talk to my doctor?"
    answer: |
      RangeFit is an educational and fitness tool, not medical advice. Always consult your
      healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have
      diabetes or other medical conditions. We're here to support your fitness journey
      alongside your medical care.

  - id: cancel-anytime
    question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?"
    answer: |
      Yes! If you upgrade to a paid plan, you can cancel anytime with no cancellation fees.
      The free plan requires no commitment at all - just download and try it out.

  - id: works-with-diet
    question: "Do I need to follow a special diet?"
    answer: |
      No special diet is required. However, exercise and nutrition work together for blood
      sugar management. Our plans focus on the exercise side, but we do provide general
      guidance on eating for stable energy. We recommend working with a nutritionist for
      personalized diet advice.
