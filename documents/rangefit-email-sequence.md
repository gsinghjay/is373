---

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Your 7-day glucose-friendly workout plan is ready:

**[Button: Download Your Plan (PDF)]**

Before you dive in, let me tell you why this plan exists.

I'm Jay, and I created RangeFit because I was tired of seeing the same expensive, one-size-fits-all fitness advice that doesn't work for people managing blood sugar.

**Here's the truth:**

Most workout apps are designed for healthy, athletic 25-year-olds without insulin resistance. They don't account for:
- Energy crashes mid-workout
- Blood sugar spikes after intense exercise
- The reality of having limited time and money

So I built something different. Simple workouts that work *with* your body's glucose patterns, not against them.

**Your plan includes:**
- 3 workouts (20 minutes each—that's it)
- Timing guide for stable energy
- Simple tracking sheet (no CGM or fancy tech)

**Quick question:** What's your biggest challenge with exercise right now?

(Seriously, hit reply. I read every email and want to help.)

Let's do this,
Jay

P.S. Start Day 1 whenever you're ready. No rush, no pressure. Just show up and move.

**ConvertKit Setup Notes:**
- Tag subscriber: "Free Plan Downloaded"

## Email #2: Sarah's Story (Social Proof)
**Send:** Day 2 (24 hours after Email #1)
**Goal:** Build trust through relatable testimonial

---

**Subject Line:** "I didn't crash at 3pm for the first time in months"

**Preview Text:** Sarah's story might sound familiar...

---

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

I want to introduce you to Sarah.

She's 29, teaches elementary school, and has PCOS. She downloaded the same free plan you have now.

Here's her email to me after Week 1:

---

*"Jay, I have to tell you—I did all 3 workouts this week and I didn't crash at 3pm. Not once.*

*I've been dealing with afternoon energy crashes for YEARS. My doctor said 'exercise more,' but every time I tried a workout app, I'd feel good during the workout and then completely tank an hour later.*

*Your plan is different. I'm not doing crazy HIIT or pushing myself to exhaustion. Just 20 minutes of movement that makes sense for my body.*

*I feel like I finally found something I can stick with."*

— Sarah C., Elementary Teacher (PCOS)

---

**Why am I sharing this?**

Because Sarah's experience is exactly what I see over and over. When you stop following generic fitness advice and start moving in a way that respects your glucose patterns, everything changes.

**You don't need:**
- A $130/month CGM app
- 90-minute gym sessions
- Perfect macros and meal timing

**You just need:**
- 20 minutes, 3 times per week
- Workouts timed for stable energy
- Consistency (not perfection)

**How's your plan going so far?**

If you've started, reply and let me know how Day 1 felt. If you haven't started yet, no judgment—just pick a day this week and try Workout #1.

You got this,
Jay

P.S. Sarah's now on our $14.99/month Premium plan and has a whole community cheering her on. More on that later this week.

---

**ConvertKit Setup Notes:**
- Include link to video testimonial if you have one (YouTube/Loom)
- Optional: Add photo of "Sarah" (stock photo or real with permission)

## Email #3: The 3 Mistakes (Education + Authority)
**Send:** Day 3 (48 hours after Email #1)
**Goal:** Position as authority, provide value

---

**Subject Line:** 3 workout mistakes that spike blood sugar

**Preview Text:** (And why most fitness advice gets this wrong)

---

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

You're on Day 3 of your plan, so let's talk about what you're *not* doing—and why that matters.

Here are the 3 biggest mistakes I see people make with exercise and blood sugar:

---

**Mistake #1: High-intensity workouts first thing in the morning**

**Why it's a problem:** Your cortisol (stress hormone) is already elevated in the morning. Add intense exercise, and you spike your blood sugar even more.

**What to do instead:** Save intense workouts for mid-morning or early afternoon when cortisol is lower. Morning? Go for a walk or light movement.

---

**Mistake #2: Working out on an empty stomach**

**Why it's a problem:** "Fasted cardio" works great for metabolically healthy people. For those of us with insulin resistance? It can crash your blood sugar mid-workout.

**What to do instead:** Small snack 30-60 mins before (apple + almond butter, banana, handful of nuts). Stabilizes energy without spiking glucose.

---

**Mistake #3: Pushing through exhaustion to "earn" rest**

**Why it's a problem:** If your body is tired, it's usually because your glucose regulation is off. Pushing harder makes it worse.

**What to do instead:** Match intensity to how you *feel*. Low energy day = gentle movement. High energy day = challenge yourself.

---

**See the pattern?**

Generic fitness advice ignores your body's signals. Glucose-friendly fitness *listens* to them.

That's why your free plan has 3 intensity levels for each workout. You pick based on how you feel that day.

**Want to see what's next?**

Later this week, I'll show you how our AI takes this concept even further—automatically adjusting your workouts based on your patterns.

(Spoiler: It's like having a coach who knows your body better than you do.)

Keep moving,
Jay

P.S. Reply and tell me: Which mistake were you making? (My bet is #3—most of us push too hard.)

---

**ConvertKit Setup Notes:**
- Optional: Link to blog post expanding on these mistakes
- Track clicks if you want to see engagement

## Email #4: Community Invite (Unity)
**Send:** Day 4 (72 hours after Email #1)
**Goal:** Activate Unity persuasion, introduce community

---

**Subject Line:** You're not doing this alone

**Preview Text:** 2,000+ people are in this with you

---

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Quick question: How are you feeling after 3-4 days with the plan?

Before you answer, I want to show you something.

**[Screenshot: Discord #wins channel with recent messages]**

This is our RangeFit community. Right now, 2,000+ people are:
- Sharing their workout wins
- Asking questions about glucose-friendly exercise
- Supporting each other through the tough days
- Celebrating energy improvements, weight loss, and better lab results

**Here's what people shared this week:**

---

**Maria (Pre-diabetic):**
"Finished Week 2 and my fasting glucose dropped from 112 to 103! My doctor is thrilled."

**Jen (PCOS):**
"I was nervous to start but this community made it easy. Everyone's so supportive and real."

**Lisa (Type 2):**
"I haven't felt this energized in YEARS. Who knew 20-minute workouts could do this?"

---

**Why does this matter?**

Because changing habits alone is hard. Doing it with people who *get it*—who understand the 3pm crashes, the confusion, the frustration—makes all the difference.

**You're invited.**

I'm opening up a preview of our Discord community to everyone on the free plan this week. No commitment, no pressure. Just come say hi and meet others on the same journey.

**[Button: Join the Community (Free)]**

Inside, you'll find:
- #wins channel (celebrate your progress)
- #questions channel (I answer personally)
- #pcos-crew, #t2d-support (find your people)
- Weekly challenges to keep you motivated

**Fair warning:** Once you join, it's hard to leave. The energy is addictive.

See you inside,
Jay

P.S. If Discord isn't your thing, no worries. You're still getting valuable emails this week. But if you want to feel less alone in this? Come hang with us.

---

**ConvertKit Setup Notes:**
- Create Discord invite link (set to never expire)
- Tag people who click: "Clicked Discord Link"
- Optional: Require email verification to join Discord (connect via Zapier)

## Email #5: How the AI Works (Authority + Differentiation)
**Send:** Day 5 (96 hours after Email #1)
**Goal:** Explain differentiation, tease trial offer

---

**Subject Line:** How RangeFit AI actually works (simple version)

**Preview Text:** It's not magic—it's pattern recognition

---

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

You've been using the free 7-day plan. It's good, right?

But let me tell you what happens when you level up to RangeFit Premium.

**The difference: AI personalization.**

Here's how it works (simple version, no tech jargon):

---

**Step 1: You log how you feel**

After each workout, you note:
- Energy level (low/medium/high)
- How the workout felt (too easy, just right, too hard)
- Optional: Blood sugar reading (if you have a meter)

**Step 2: Our AI looks for patterns**

Over 2-3 weeks, it learns:
- Which workout times give you the most stable energy
- Which intensity levels work best for your body
- How your patterns compare to 2,000+ other members

**Step 3: Your workouts adapt automatically**

Instead of following the same plan as everyone else:
- You get workout recommendations tailored to *your* patterns
- Intensity adjusts based on how you've been feeling
- Timing suggestions optimize for your schedule and energy

---

**Think of it like this:**

**Free Plan (what you have now):** A great trainer who gives you solid general advice.

**RangeFit Premium (AI):** A coach who studies your body for weeks and builds a custom program just for you.

---

**Real example:**

Sarah (from Day 2's email) learned through the AI that:
- Her best workout time is 10am (not 6am like she thought)
- Moderate-intensity workouts work better than high-intensity
- She needs 2 rest days per week, not 1

**Result:** Her energy stabilized, her glucose improved, and she actually *enjoys* working out now.

---

**Want to try it?**

Tomorrow, I'm opening up a special $4.99 trial (normally $14.99/month) so you can experience the AI yourself.

It's 7 days, fully featured, cancel anytime. If it doesn't work for you, no hard feelings.

I'll send the details tomorrow. Keep an eye on your inbox.

For now, keep crushing your free plan,
Jay

P.S. The AI isn't magic—it's just paying attention to what your body is telling you. But after 2,000+ members, I can tell you: it works.

---

**ConvertKit Setup Notes:**
- Optional: Link to demo video or GIF showing AI in action
- Tag subscribers: "Engaged with AI explanation" (if they click links)

## Email #6: Trial Offer (Main Conversion Email)
**Send:** Day 6 (120 hours after Email #1)
**Goal:** Convert to $4.99 trial (this is your money email)

---

**Subject Line:** Try RangeFit Premium for $4.99 (7 days)

**Preview Text:** Your exclusive trial starts now (expires Friday)

---

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

You've made it through the free 7-day plan. Nice work.

Now it's decision time.

**Option 1:** Keep doing the free plan on repeat. (Totally fine—no judgment.)

**Option 2:** See what happens when the AI takes over. (This is where it gets interesting.)

---

**For the next 48 hours, you can try RangeFit Premium for just $4.99.**

Here's what you get for 7 days:

✓ **AI-personalized workouts** (adapted to your patterns)
✓ **Community access** (Discord with 2,000+ members)
✓ **Progress tracking** (see your energy and glucose trends)
✓ **Unlimited workout library** (not just 3 workouts)
✓ **Direct support** (ask me anything, I answer personally)

**After 7 days:** $14.99/month (cancel anytime, no commitment)

---

**Why $4.99?**

Because I want to remove every excuse. A fancy coffee costs more than this trial. If it doesn't work, cancel before Day 7. No hard feelings, no hassle.

**But here's what I know:** If you stick with it for 7 days, you won't want to leave.

---

**What people say after their trial:**

"I was skeptical, but the AI really does work. It suggested I switch my workout time to 10am and I haven't crashed at 3pm since." — Sarah C.

"$14.99/month vs. $130 for Signos? No-brainer. RangeFit does the same thing for 10x less." — Maria T.

"I found my people. The community alone is worth it." — Jen K.

---

**Ready?**

Click below to start your $4.99 trial. You'll get instant access.

**[Button: Start My $4.99 Trial]**

Trial ends: Friday, 11:59pm

After that, it's back to full price. (Still only $14.99/month, but hey, save $10 now.)

---

**Still not sure? Let me answer the top 3 questions:**

**Q: Do I need a CGM or glucose monitor?**
A: Nope. You *can* log glucose if you have a meter, but the AI works with just energy tracking too.

**Q: What if I'm not tech-savvy?**
A: If you can use TikTok, you can use RangeFit. It's stupid simple.

**Q: Can I really cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. One click in your account settings. No hoops, no "are you sure?" spam emails.

---

**This offer expires Friday.**

After that, it's gone. So if you've been on the fence, now's the time.

Let's do this,
Jay

P.S. When you sign up, introduce yourself in the Discord #welcome channel. I want to know what brought you here. (And trust me, the community will hype you up.)

**[Button: Start My $4.99 Trial]**

---

**ConvertKit Setup Notes:**

## Email #7: Last Chance (Final Urgency Push)
**Send:** Day 7 (144 hours / 6 days after Email #1)
**Goal:** Final conversion push with scarcity

---

**Subject Line:** Your $4.99 trial expires tonight

**Preview Text:** Last chance to join 2,000+ members

---

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

This is it. Your $4.99 trial offer expires tonight at midnight.

After that, it's back to the regular $14.99/month price (no trial).

**If you've been thinking about it, don't wait.**

---

**Here's what you're missing:**

Right now, 2,000+ people are:
- Using AI to optimize their workouts
- Supporting each other in the Discord
- Improving their energy, glucose, and confidence

**You could be one of them.**

**[Button: Start My $4.99 Trial (Expires Tonight)]**

---

**Real talk:**

I get it. Change is hard. Trying something new feels risky.

But here's the thing: The 3pm energy crashes? The confusion about what exercise is "safe"? The frustration with expensive apps? **That's your life right now.**

What if 7 days from now, you felt different?

What if you had:
- Stable energy all day
- A workout plan that actually fits your body
- A community that gets it

**That's what $4.99 gets you.**

Less than a latte. Less than a smoothie. Less than a single day of not having to Google "best exercise for insulin resistance" for the 100th time.

---

**Two paths from here:**

**Path 1:** Keep doing what you're doing. Maybe it works out. Maybe it doesn't.

**Path 2:** Try something new for 7 days. If it sucks, cancel. If it works, you just changed your life for $14.99/month.

---

**Your call.**

**[Button: Start My Trial Now]**

Offer expires: Tonight, 11:59pm

After that, this email will self-destruct. (Kidding. But the offer really does expire.)

Let's do this together,
Jay

P.S. If you're not ready, that's okay. Keep using the free plan. But don't let "later" turn into "never." Your energy matters. You deserve to feel good.

- Test: "Your $4.99 trial is ready (48 hours only)"
- Test: "Join 2,000+ members for less than a coffee"

### CTA Button Text to Test:

- Current: "Start My $4.99 Trial"
- Test: "Yes, I Want This"
- Test: "Try RangeFit Now"
- Test: "Get Started for $4.99"

### Timing to Test:

## FAQ: Common Questions About This Sequence

**Q: Can I shorten this to 5 days instead of 7?**
A: Yes. Combine Emails #4 and #5, then send trial offer on Day 4, last chance on Day 5. But 7 days gives more time to build trust.

**Q: Should I include discounts or bonuses in the trial offer?**
A: The $4.99 trial IS the discount (from $14.99). Don't over-complicate. Simplicity converts.

**Q: What if people reply and ask questions?**
A: Answer them! Personally. Every reply is a chance to build trust and address objections. Set aside 15 mins/day for this.

**Q: Can I reuse this sequence for people who didn't convert?**
A: Not the same sequence. Create a separate "re-engagement" sequence 2-3 weeks later with a fresh angle.

**Q: Do I need to write new emails every week after this?**
A: No. After Day 7, put them on a weekly newsletter (1 email/week with tips, community highlights, etc.). Keep it light.
