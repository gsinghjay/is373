# RangeFit: Customer Discovery Single Source of Truth

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Project:** RangeFit - Glucose-Aware AI Fitness for Everyone
**Owner:** Jay Singh
**Status:** Pre-Launch / Validation Phase

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:** The glucose-aware fitness market is dominated by expensive, medicalized solutions ($129-139/month) targeting weight loss. There is no accessible, "Everyman" positioned solution for everyday people with diabetes, pre-diabetes, or PCOS who want adaptive AI fitness coaching.

**The Solution:** RangeFit delivers affordable ($14.99/month), adaptive AI-powered glucose-aware fitness coaching with community support and mainstream positioning - not clinical, intimidating, or overpriced.

**The Gap We Fill:**
- Archetype: First "Everyman" brand in glucose fitness space
- Persuasion: Unity ("people like us") and Social Proof missing from competitors
- Funnel: Competitors have weak BOFU and Post-Purchase strategies
- Price: 10x more affordable than Signos, with accessible entry points

---

## 1. Media Bubble Evidence

**Topic:** Glucose-aware AI fitness, CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring), insulin-resistance friendly fitness, PCOS health

**Evidence of Presence in Media Bubble:**
- TikTok feeds showing CGM devices, "low blood sugar at HomeGoods" content
- Instagram reels on PCOS-friendly workouts
- Fitness influencers discussing glucose spikes and workout timing
- Diet apps integrating with glucose monitors
- YouTube content on pre-diabetes lifestyle changes

**Visual Evidence:** Collected screenshots of TikTok CGM content and outdoor fitness with glucose themes (see pitch deck slides 2)

**Why This Matters:** This is a growing, algorithmically-validated interest area with demonstrated engagement and commercial activity.

## 3. Content Audit Highlights

### High-Performing Content Patterns

**Signos TikTok:**
- Format: 15-30 second tips, relatable scenarios
- Hook: "POV: Low blood sugar at HomeGoods"
- Engagement: High (likes, shares, comments)
- CTA: Link in bio to glucose guide

**January AI Blog:**
- Format: 1000-2000 word scientific articles
- Hook: Research-backed health claims
- Engagement: Low viral reach, high authority signal
- CTA: Download app for predictions

**Fitbod Instagram:**
- Format: Workout memes, exercise demos
- Hook: Relatable fitness humor
- Engagement: Good likes, low saves (low conversion intent)
- CTA: Try app for free

### Key Observation

**Lifestyle hooks outperform clinical content** in virality and engagement. However, clinical content builds authority and trust for conversion.

**Implication for RangeFit:** Lead with lifestyle-focused, relatable TOFU content, transition to authority-building in MOFU, close with social proof + unity messaging in BOFU.

---

## 4. Gap Analysis

### Audience Gap
**Who's Underserved:**
- Everyday people with diabetes (Type 1, Type 2)
- Pre-diabetics seeking preventive fitness
- Women with PCOS managing insulin resistance
- Budget-conscious health seekers ($15-30/mo willingness to pay)

**Why They're Underserved:**
- Existing solutions are either expensive ($129+) or generic (no glucose awareness)
- Clinical positioning creates intimidation and "not for me" feeling
- No community/belonging messaging ("people like us")

### Archetype Gap
**Missing:** Everyman positioning in this space
- Signos = Hero ("master your metabolism")
- January AI = Sage ("understand the science")
- Nutrisense/Levels = Ruler ("premium optimization")
- GlucoseZone = Caregiver ("safe and structured")
- Fitbod = Hero ("strongest self")

**No one says:** "This is for normal people like us who want to feel better"

### Persuasion Gap
**Unity ("people like us") is almost entirely missing:**
- No community-first messaging
- No identity-based belonging
- No "join others like you" positioning

**Social Proof is present but not Unity** - testimonials show "it worked for me" but not "I found my people"

### Funnel Weakness Gap
**BOFU (Bottom of Funnel):**
- Competitors rely heavily on Authority and Scarcity
- Missing: Strong Unity + Social Proof combo at decision point

**Post-Purchase:**
- Most competitors treat this as retention-only
- Missing: Community belonging, success sharing, referral loops
- Opportunity: Turn customers into evangelists through Unity

---

## 5. Opportunity Statement

**For** mainstream users with glucose concerns (pre-diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, PCOS),
**RangeFit delivers** accessible, adaptive AI fitness coaching that learns from your glucose patterns,
**By** combining affordable pricing ($14.99/mo), Everyman positioning, and community belonging,
**Unlike** competitors who are expensive ($129+), medicalized/intimidating, or have no glucose awareness,

   **Source:** [Survey, test, user interview, etc.]

*Example:*
1. **Learning:** Users don't understand "glucose-aware" terminology
   **Implication:** Simplify to "energy-stable workouts" in TOFU content
   **Source:** User interviews with first 20 trial users

## 11. Open Questions & Risks

### Open Questions to Answer
1. Can we build AI personalization with <$50K budget, or do we need to start with rules-based?
2. What's the minimum viable community size to trigger Unity effect? (50 members? 200?)
3. Should we focus on PCOS-only or multi-condition (diabetes, pre-diabetes) from day 1?
4. Do we need CGM integration, or can we use manual glucose logging + self-reported energy?
5. What's realistic CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) for TikTok ads in health/fitness?

### Known Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| AI doesn't work well without CGM data | Medium | High | Start with manual logging + build "directional" guidance vs. precise predictions |
| Can't compete with Signos's marketing budget | High | Medium | Lean into organic (TikTok, community) and Unity (they lack this) |
| Regulatory issues (FDA, medical claims) | Low | High | Avoid medical claims, position as "fitness guidance" not "diabetes treatment" |
| Community doesn't engage (Unity fails) | Medium | High | Seed community with engaged beta users, hire community manager early |
| Trial conversion is lower than 15% | Medium | High | Extend trial to 14 days, add more in-trial touchpoints |
| Churn is higher than 6%/month | Medium | High | Double down on habit formation in first 30 days, improve onboarding |
