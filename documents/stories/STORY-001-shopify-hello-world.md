shopify version
```

### Step 2: Create Shopify Partner Account & Dev Store
1. Go to https://partners.shopify.com/signup
2. Create Partner account
3. Create development store from Partner Dashboard
4. Note down store URL (e.g., rangefit-dev.myshopify.com)

### Step 3: Create New Shopify App
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/jay/Code/is373

# Create new app using latest template
npm init @shopify/app@latest

# Follow prompts:
# - App name: rangefit-shopify
# - Template: Remix (recommended for full-stack) or Node.js

# - Language: TypeScript (recommended)
```

**Expected Output:**

# Optional: Copy additional logo variants
cp static/images/logos/logo-horizontal_large.png rangefit-shopify/public/rangefit-logo-large.png

### Step 5: Configure App
```bash
cd rangefit-shopify

# Link to your Shopify Partner app
shopify app config link

# Follow prompts to select/create Partner app
# This creates shopify.app.toml configuration file
```

### Step 6: Customize Hello World Page

**File to Edit:** `app/routes/_index.tsx` (if using Remix template)

Example customization:
```typescript
import { Page, Layout, Card, Text, Image } from "@shopify/polaris";

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <Page>
      <Layout>
        <Layout.Section>
          <Card>
            <div style={{ textAlign: "center", padding: "2rem" }}>
              <Image
                source="/rangefit-logo.png"
                alt="RangeFit Logo"
                width={300}
              />
              <Text variant="heading2xl" as="h1">
                Hello World from RangeFit!
              </Text>
              <Text variant="bodyLg" as="p">
                AI-powered fitness tracking for PCOS & T2D management
              </Text>
            </div>
          </Card>
        </Layout.Section>
      </Layout>
    </Page>
  );
}
```

### Step 7: Start Development Server
```bash
shopify app dev

# This will:
# - Start local development server
# - Create tunnel URL for Shopify to access your local app
# - Open preview in your development store
# - Watch for file changes and hot reload
```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

### Step 8: Test in Development Store
1. Navigate to preview URL from terminal output
2. Verify logo displays correctly
3. Check "Hello World" message appears
4. Test responsiveness (resize browser window)
5. Check browser console for errors
6. Verify app appears in store admin under Apps section

### Step 9: Verify App Configuration
```bash
# Display app information
shopify app info

# Expected output: app name, version, extensions, configuration
```

### Step 10: Build App (Test Production Build)
```bash
shopify app build

# Verifies app can be built for deployment
# Should complete without errors
```
