**Created:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 1.5 hours

## User Story

**As a** developer building the RangeFit Shopify app
**I want to** implement Shopify Polaris components throughout the app interface
**So that** the app has a professional, consistent UI that matches Shopify's design system and provides a native admin experience

---

## Context & Background

Following the successful Hello World implementation (STORY-001), we need to enhance the UI with proper Shopify Polaris components. Polaris is Shopify's design system that ensures apps look and feel native within the Shopify admin.

**Why Polaris Matters:**
- Consistent UX with Shopify admin interface
- Built-in accessibility features
- Mobile-responsive by default
- Reduces development time with pre-built components
- Automatic updates when Shopify updates their design system

**Current State:**
- Basic hello world page with logo and text
- Minimal Polaris component usage
- No interactive elements or data display

**Desired State:**
- Rich UI with cards, badges, and buttons
- Data presentation using Polaris components
- Professional layout with proper spacing and structure

## Technical Notes

### Polaris Web Components
The React Router template uses Polaris web components (e.g., `<s-page>`, `<s-card>`):
- Prefix: `s-` for all components
- Attributes instead of props
- Slots for content placement

### Available Polaris Components
```javascript
// Typography
<s-heading>Title</s-heading>
<s-text>Body text</s-text>

// Layout
<s-page heading="Title">...</s-page>
<s-section>...</s-section>
<s-card>...</s-card>
<s-box>...</s-box>

// Actions
<s-button>Click me</s-button>
<s-link href="...">Link</s-link>

// Display
<s-badge>New</s-badge>
<s-icon source="..." />
<s-divider />

// Lists
<s-list>...</s-list>
<s-unordered-list>...</s-unordered-list>
