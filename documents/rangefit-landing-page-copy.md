## Landing Page: Free 7-Day Workout Plan

### Version A: Main Landing Page (Recommended)

---

#### HERO SECTION

**[Above the fold - Headline + Subhead]**

# Get Energy That Lasts All Day
## Free 7-Day Glucose-Friendly Workout Plan (No CGM Required)

Finally—workouts designed for real people managing blood sugar, not elite athletes or expensive programs.

**[Visual: Image of relatable person (woman, late 20s, casual workout clothes) doing a simple exercise outdoors or at home - NOT a gym]**

_No credit card. No CGM device. Just workouts that work._

#### PROBLEM/AGITATION SECTION

**[Icon grid - 3 columns]**

### Does This Sound Familiar?

**[Icon: Energy Crash]**
**3pm Energy Crashes**
You start strong but crash by mid-afternoon, making it hard to focus at work or enjoy your evening.

**[Icon: Confused Face]**
**Confusing Fitness Advice**
Generic workout apps don't account for blood sugar—leaving you guessing what's safe and what works.

**[Icon: Dollar Sign with X]**
**Apps Cost $100+/Month**
Signos, Nutrisense, and Levels are great...if you can afford $129-400/month. Most of us can't.

---

#### SOLUTION SECTION

### What If Workouts Could Adapt to Your Body's Energy?

That's what glucose-aware fitness is about. Instead of following the same routine as everyone else, you follow workouts designed for people managing:

- **Pre-diabetes** or Type 2 Diabetes
- **PCOS** (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)
- **Insulin resistance**
- **Blood sugar fluctuations**

**No expensive CGM required. No gym membership. Just 20 minutes, 3 times per week.**

---

#### OFFER SECTION

**[Visual: PDF mockup or preview of the workout plan]**

### Your Free 7-Day Workout Plan Includes:

✓ **3 Glucose-Stabilizing Workouts** (20 minutes each)
✓ **Exercise Timing Guide** (when to work out for stable energy)
✓ **Intensity Adjustments** (low/moderate/high based on how you feel)
✓ **Simple Tracking Sheet** (no devices needed—just note your energy)
✓ **Myth-Busting Guide** (what actually works vs. fitness bro-science)

**Used by 2,000+ people managing glucose through fitness.**

#### SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

**[Testimonial Carousel or 3-column grid]**

### What People Like You Are Saying

---

**[Testimonial 1]**
**"I didn't crash at 3pm for the first time in months"**

"I've tried so many workout apps, but they always left me exhausted. This plan is the first one that made me feel *more* energized, not less. I'm a teacher—I need energy that lasts all day."

— Sarah C., 29, Elementary Teacher (PCOS)

---

**[Testimonial 2]**
**"Finally, something I can afford"**

"I wanted to try Signos but $130/month? No way. This free plan gave me the foundation I needed, and now I'm hooked on RangeFit. Best $15/month I spend."

— Maria T., 35, Pre-diabetic

---

**[Testimonial 3]**
**"My fasting glucose dropped 12 points"**

"I started the free plan just to see if it worked. Three weeks later, my fasting glucose went from 108 to 96. My doctor was shocked. I wasn't—this stuff just makes sense."

— Jen K., 41, Type 2 Diabetes

---

#### AUTHORITY/SCIENCE SECTION

**[Simple, non-clinical explanation]**

### Why Glucose-Aware Fitness Works

When your blood sugar spikes or crashes, your body either stores fat or burns through energy too fast. Traditional workouts ignore this.

**Glucose-friendly workouts:**
- Time exercise when your body can use glucose efficiently
- Match intensity to your current energy state
- Build muscle slowly (which improves insulin sensitivity over time)

**The result:** Stable energy, better mood, and sustainable fat loss—without the crashes.

_No medical degree required. Just simple workouts that work with your body._
