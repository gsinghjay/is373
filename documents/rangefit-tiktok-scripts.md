## Performance Tracking & Iteration

### Track These Metrics (Weekly):

| Video # | Views | Likes | Comments | Shares | Link Clicks | Download Rate |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Video 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Video 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| ... | - | - | - | - | - | - |

**How to track:**
- **Views/Likes/Comments/Shares:** TikTok analytics (built-in)
- **Link Clicks:** Plausible Analytics or URL shortener (bit.ly)
- **Downloads:** ConvertKit form submissions

---

### What to Look For:

**High performers (double down on these):**
- Views: 10K+
- Engagement rate: >5% (likes + comments + shares / views)
- Link clicks: 4-8% of viewers
- Downloads: 20-30% of link clickers

**Low performers (learn and iterate):**
- Views: <2K
- Engagement rate: <2%
- Link clicks: <2%

**Action:**
- Make more videos like high performers
- Test variations of low performers (different hook, shorter, different tone)
- Pay attention to comments (what questions are people asking?)

---

---

## Content Variations to Test (After Week 4)

Once you know what works, test these variations:

### Hooks to Test:
- "If you have PCOS, watch this"
- "Stop doing [X] if you have insulin resistance"
- "I tried [expensive app] vs. RangeFit—here's what happened"
- "My doctor told me to exercise more, but didn't tell me this"

### Formats to Test:
- Day-in-the-life vlogs
- "Get ready with me" while talking about glucose fitness
- Duet/stitch popular PCOS or fitness creators
- Myth-busting series ("Top 5 lies about insulin resistance")

### Trends to Jump On:
- Use trending audio (check TikTok Discover page)
- Participate in challenges (#PCOSAwareness month, etc.)
- React to viral health/fitness content with your POV

---

## FAQ: TikTok Production Questions

**Q: Do I need to show my face?**
A: Not always. Videos #1, #4, #7 can be voiceover + B-roll. But showing your face builds trust faster.

**Q: What if I'm not comfortable on camera?**
A: Start with text-only videos (B-roll + text overlays). Build confidence over time. Authenticity > production quality.

**Q: How do I get more views?**
A: Consistency matters more than virality. Post 3-5x/week for 4 weeks. TikTok rewards consistent creators.

**Q: Should I use trending sounds?**
A: Yes, when appropriate. But original audio (your voice) builds personal connection. Mix both.

**Q: Can I repurpose these for Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts?**
A: Absolutely. Film once, post everywhere. Just adjust captions for each platform.

**Q: What if I don't get views at first?**
A: Normal. TikTok algorithm takes 5-10 videos to understand your content. Keep posting. One video will hit.
