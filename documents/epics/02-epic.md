## Original Epic Description

Excellent work! You have successfully implemented the vast majority of the rebranding plan. The new color scheme is in place, the content has been updated across most sections, and the site truly feels like **RangeFit**.

I've carefully compared the screenshot of your built site against the plan. We are about 95% of the way there. I've identified a few remaining areas where the old "Legs on the Ground" content is still present.

Here is a final, targeted plan to fix these remaining items and complete the transformation.

### **Final Polish: Step-by-Step Fixes**

#### **1. Update the Hero Trust Bar**

The trust badges below the main hero buttons are still from the old property management site. Let's replace them with trust signals that are relevant to RangeFit.

*   **File to Edit:** `templates/sections/hero.html`

Find this `hero-trust-bar` section:

```html
<!-- Trust Bar - Integrated Above the Fold -->
<div class="hero-trust-bar flex justify-center items-center flex-wrap">
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>
        <span>Fully Insured</span>
    </div>
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-award"></i>
        <span>30+ Years Experience</span>
    </div>
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-certificate"></i>
        <span>Licensed & Bonded</span>
    </div>
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-users"></i>
        <span>100+ Happy Clients</span>
    </div>
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>
        <span>24/7 Availability</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Replace it with this new code** that reflects the RangeFit brand promises:

```html
<!-- Trust Bar for RangeFit -->
<div class="hero-trust-bar flex justify-center items-center flex-wrap">
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-leaf"></i>
        <span>Beginner Friendly</span>
    </div>
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-robot"></i>
        <span>AI-Powered</span>
    </div>
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>
        <span>Science-Backed</span>
    </div>
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-users"></i>
        <span>2,000+ Members</span>
    </div>
    <div class="trust-item flex items-center">
        <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>
        <span>100% Free Plan</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### **2. Fix Section Subtitles**

Two sections still have subtitles from the old site.

**A. "Fitness That Feels Like It's Made For You" Section:**

*   **File to Edit:** `templates/sections/why-choose.html`
*   **Find this line:** `<p class="section-subtitle">Your trusted partner for property management in Puerto Rico</p>`
*   **Replace it with:** `<p class="section-subtitle">An approach to fitness designed for real people, not elite athletes.</p>`

**B. "What Our Clients Say" Section:**

*   **File to Edit:** `templates/sections/testimonials.html`
*   **Find this line:** `<p class="section-subtitle">Real experiences from property owners we've helped</p>`
*   **Replace it with:** `<p class="section-subtitle">Real stories from people just like you.</p>`

#### **3. Overhaul the FAQ Section**

This is the largest remaining piece. The entire FAQ section is still about property management. We'll make this data-driven and populate it with relevant RangeFit questions.

**A. Create a New Data File:**

*   Create a new file named `faq.yaml` inside the `content/data/` directory.
*   **File to Create:** `content/data/faq.yaml`
*   Copy the following content into this new file:

```yaml
# RangeFit Frequently Asked Questions
faq:
  - id: need-cgm
    question: "Do I need a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) to use RangeFit?"
    answer: |
      No! While you can input glucose readings if you have them, our AI is designed to work 
      just as well by learning from your self-reported energy levels, workout performance, 
      and daily feelings. This makes it a powerful and affordable alternative to expensive CGM-based apps.

  - id: for-beginners
    question: "I'm a complete beginner to exercise. Is this for me?"
    answer: |
      Absolutely. RangeFit is designed for the 'Everyman', not elite athletes. Workouts are 
      simple, require no gym, and can be adjusted to any fitness level. Our goal is progress, 
      not perfection.

  - id: for-my-condition
    question: "Does this work for PCOS, Pre-diabetes, or Type 2 Diabetes?"
    answer: |
      Yes. The core principles of glucose-aware fitness benefit anyone managing insulin 
      resistance, which is a key factor in all these conditions. Our AI adapts to *your* 
      body's unique patterns, regardless of the specific diagnosis.

  - id: different-from-others
    question: "How is this different from MyFitnessPal or Peloton?"
    answer: |
      Those are great apps, but they are 'glucose-unaware'. They don't adapt your exercise 
      based on how it impacts your blood sugar and energy. RangeFit's AI is specifically 
      designed to find workouts that give you stable energy all day, which is a game-changer.

  - id: lose-weight
    question: "Will I lose weight with RangeFit?"
    answer: |
      Many of our members do lose weight, but our primary goal is to help you feel more 
      energized and in control. Weight loss is often a happy side effect of stabilizing 
      your blood sugar and building a consistent fitness habit.

  - id: time-commitment
    question: "How much time does it take?"
    answer: |
      Our plans are designed for busy lives. Most workouts are just 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times 
      per week. We believe consistency is more important than intensity.
```

**B. Update the FAQ Template:**

*   Now, we'll tell the template to read from your new data file.
*   **File to Edit:** `templates/sections/faq.html`
*   **Replace the entire file** with this new, data-driven code:

```html
<section class="faq-section" id="faq">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section-header">
            <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Your questions, answered.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-container">
            {% for item in faq %}
            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question flex items-center justify-between" aria-expanded="false">
                    <span>{{ item.question }}</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>{{ item.answer | safe }}</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
```

#### **4. Fix the Contact Form Layout**

The "What You'll Get" sidebar next to the contact form is missing. It seems the code for it was removed instead of updated. Let's add it back.

*   **File to Edit:** `templates/sections/contact-form.html`
*   **Replace the entire file** with this corrected version that includes the sidebar:

```html
<section class="contact-form-section" id="free-plan">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section-header">
            <h2 class="section-title">Get Your Free 7-Day Plan</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Enter your name and email below, and we'll send it to you instantly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contact-form-wrapper">
            <!-- TO ACTIVATE FORM: Sign up at formspree.io and replace YOUR_FORM_ID below -->
            <form class="contact-form" id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
                <div class="form-row grid">
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="name">First Name <span class="required">*</span></label>
                        <input
                            type="text"
                            id="name"
                            name="name"
                            required
                            placeholder="Sarah"
                            aria-required="true">
                    </div>

                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="email">Email Address <span class="required">*</span></label>
                        <input
                            type="email"
                            id="email"
                            name="email"
                            required
                            placeholder="sarah@example.com"
                            aria-required="true">
                    </div>
                </div>
