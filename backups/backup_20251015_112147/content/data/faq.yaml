# RangeFit Frequently Asked Questions
faq:
  - id: need-cgm
    question: "Do I need a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) to use RangeFit?"
    answer: |
      No! While you can input glucose readings if you have them, our AI is designed to work
      just as well by learning from your self-reported energy levels, workout performance,
      and daily feelings. This makes it a powerful and affordable alternative to expensive CGM-based apps.

  - id: for-beginners
    question: "I'm a complete beginner to exercise. Is this for me?"
    answer: |
      Absolutely. RangeFit is designed for the 'Everyman', not elite athletes. Workouts are
      simple, require no gym, and can be adjusted to any fitness level. Our goal is progress,
      not perfection.

  - id: for-my-condition
    question: "Does this work for PCOS, Pre-diabetes, or Type 2 Diabetes?"
    answer: |
      Yes. The core principles of glucose-aware fitness benefit anyone managing insulin
      resistance, which is a key factor in all these conditions. Our AI adapts to *your*
      body's unique patterns, regardless of the specific diagnosis.

  - id: different-from-others
    question: "How is this different from MyFitnessPal or Peloton?"
    answer: |
      Those are great apps, but they are 'glucose-unaware'. They don't adapt your exercise
      based on how it impacts your blood sugar and energy. RangeFit's AI is specifically
      designed to find workouts that give you stable energy all day, which is a game-changer.

  - id: lose-weight
    question: "Will I lose weight with RangeFit?"
    answer: |
      Many of our members do lose weight, but our primary goal is to help you feel more
      energized and in control. Weight loss is often a happy side effect of stabilizing
      your blood sugar and building a consistent fitness habit.

  - id: time-commitment
    question: "How much time does it take?"
    answer: |
      Our plans are designed for busy lives. Most workouts are just 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times
      per week. We believe consistency is more important than intensity.
