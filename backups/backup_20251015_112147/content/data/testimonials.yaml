      I've tried so many workout apps, but they always left me exhausted. This is the
      first one that made me feel *more* energized, not less. I didn't crash at 3pm
      for the first time in months.

      I wanted to try Signos but $130/month? No way. RangeFit does the same thing for
      10x less. My fasting glucose dropped 12 points in the first three weeks.
      My doctor was shocked.

      The community alone is worth the price. It's so encouraging to talk to people
      who just *get it*. I finally feel like I'm not doing this alone.
