## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Launch an affordable, AI-powered glucose-aware fitness platform via Shopify that serves the underserved mainstream market at $14.99/month
- Validate the content-led growth funnel (TikTok → Free lead magnet → Email nurture → Trial → Subscription) with 50+ paying members by Day 90
- Establish RangeFit as the "Everyman" alternative with Unity positioning (community-first, relatable, accessible)
- Achieve 15-20% trial-to-paid conversion and 18-24% D30 retention proving product-market fit
- Build an engaged Discord community of 100+ members demonstrating Unity persuasion effectiveness
- Enable solo-founder operation through no-code/low-code automation stack under $50/month budget
- Create a complete trial experience delivery system (email-based workouts + community access) without requiring a mobile app
- Prove organic TikTok content can drive 500+ free plan downloads in first 60 days

### Background Context

The glucose-aware fitness market is currently polarized between prohibitively expensive clinical solutions ($129-400/month requiring CGM devices) and generic fitness apps that completely ignore blood sugar patterns. 30+ million Americans managing pre-diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and PCOS face confusion, energy crashes, and lack of affordable guidance on exercise that works with their metabolic challenges. No competitor has claimed the accessible, community-first "people like us" positioning that resonates with budget-conscious individuals.

RangeFit addresses this gap through a Shopify-based subscription business that delivers adaptive workout personalization via email and Discord at 10x lower cost than competitors. The MVP leverages existing SaaS tools (ConvertKit, Shopify, Discord, Zapier) to validate the business model before investing in custom app development. By targeting Sarah Chen—a 29-year-old teacher with PCOS earning $52K/year—RangeFit can capture the underserved mainstream market through relatable TikTok content, low-friction $4.99 trials, and strong community belonging rather than clinical intimidation.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

RangeFit's user experience must feel **approachable, supportive, and community-driven**—the antithesis of clinical, intimidating glucose apps like Levels or Signos. The visual language should evoke a friendly fitness coach, not a medical device. Every interaction should reinforce the "people like us" positioning through warm, relatable copy, encouraging micro-interactions (like logging energy levels with simple emoji selectors), and prominent community elements.

The UX prioritizes **reducing friction at every conversion point**: landing page to lead capture should feel effortless (single form field if possible), trial signup should feel low-risk ($4.99 with clear value), and workout selection should be simple ("What's my energy level today?" → recommended workout). The experience should feel **designed for busy people** (teachers, service workers) who want guidance without overwhelm—minimal clicks, clear next steps, and celebration of small wins.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**1. Guided Discovery over Exploration:**
Users shouldn't face decision paralysis. The member dashboard presents "Your workout for today" based on simple inputs (energy level, time available) rather than forcing users to browse 21 workouts. Progressive disclosure—show less upfront, reveal more as users engage.

**2. Micro-Logging with Minimal Friction:**
Energy logging uses emoji/tap interactions (😓 Low / 😐 Medium / 😊 High) instead of long forms. Workout completion is a single tap. Build habit loops with immediate positive reinforcement ("Great job! 🎉 3-day streak!").

**3. Community-First Navigation:**
Discord community link is prominently featured on every member page (header nav, dashboard widget). Member count and recent wins are visible to reinforce Unity. Users should feel they're part of a movement, not isolated customers.

**4. Mobile-First, Thumb-Friendly Design:**
Primary actions (Start Workout, Log Energy, Join Discord) are within easy thumb reach on mobile screens. Minimize text input—use taps, swipes, and selections wherever possible.

### Core Screens and Views

**Public (Pre-Signup):**
1. **Landing Page** - Hero with headline, social proof (member count, testimonials), free workout plan CTA
2. **Free Plan Download Thank You** - Immediate PDF download + email confirmation + trial offer preview

**Trial/Member Experience:**
3. **Member Dashboard** - "Your workout for today" + progress stats (streak, workouts completed) + Discord community widget + energy check-in
4. **Workout Library** - Filterable grid of workouts (by intensity, duration, type) with clear glucose-awareness labels
5. **Workout Detail Page** - Video/instructions, duration, intensity, glucose guidance, "Start Workout" CTA, post-workout energy log
6. **Progress Tracker** - Simple visual (calendar heatmap or progress bar) showing completed workouts, streaks, energy trends
7. **Account/Subscription Management** - Shopify customer portal for payment, plan changes, cancellation

**Admin (Solo Founder):**
8. **Content Management** - Shopify admin for adding/editing workout content (WYSIWYG, no coding required)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Alt text for all workout images/videos
- Clear focus indicators for form fields and buttons

**Rationale:** Target users may have diabetes-related vision impairment, mobile-first design requires clear tap targets (44x44px minimum), and form validation/error messages must be screen-reader friendly.

### Branding

**Design Direction:** Replicate the **"Legs on the Ground v2.0"** design system (found in `docs/styles.css` and `docs/index.html`)

**Extracted Design Specifications:**

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary Blue:** `#38B2FF` (trust, calm) - used for primary actions
- **Accent Green:** `#38A169` (health, success) - used for success states and icons
- **Neutrals:** Warm grays (`#718096` body text, `#2D3748` headings, `#F7FAFC` backgrounds)
- **Legacy mappings:** CSS variables support coral/navy/teal aliases that map to blue/green for compatibility

**Typography System:**
- **Display Font:** "Plus Jakarta Sans" (headings, hero titles)
- **Body Font:** "Inter" (paragraphs, UI text)
- **Type Scale:** Major Third ratio (1.25) - 16px base to 61px (h1)
- **Font Weights:** 400 (normal), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold), 800 (extrabold)

**Component Patterns:**
- **Cards:** White background, rounded-lg (12px), subtle shadow, hover lift effect (-6px transform)
- **Buttons:** Gradient backgrounds, semibold text, min-height 42px, rounded-lg
  - Primary: Coral gradient → Navy on hover
  - Outline: Transparent with border → Filled on hover
- **Hero Section:** Dark overlay gradient, compact padding, centered content, trust badges below CTA
- **FAQ Accordion:** Animated chevron toggle, gradient accent on active state, smooth max-height transition

**Spacing System:**
- 8pt grid system (`--space-base: 1rem / 16px`)
- Scale: xs(4px), sm(8px), md(12px), base(16px), lg(24px), xl(32px), 2xl(40px), up to 8xl(160px)

**Utility-First Approach:**
- Comprehensive utility classes (flex, grid, spacing, typography, colors)
- Similar to Tailwind CSS philosophy
- All components built with utility composition

**Shopify Implementation Notes:**
- This existing static site uses custom CSS - will need to adapt to Shopify Liquid theme structure
- Design system can be ported to Shopify theme's `assets/theme.css.liquid`
- Component patterns should map to Shopify sections (hero.liquid, product-grid.liquid, etc.)

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive (Mobile-First)

**Primary:** Mobile web (iOS Safari, Chrome Android) - 60%+ of traffic from TikTok
**Secondary:** Desktop web (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge - last 2 versions)
**Not Required:** Native mobile apps (deferred to post-MVP)

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320px - 767px (primary design target)
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+

**Mobile-Specific Considerations:**
- Video content must be optimized for mobile bandwidth (low data usage)
- Forms auto-zoom on focus to prevent viewport issues
- Bottom navigation or sticky CTAs for thumb accessibility
- Fast page transitions (no heavy animations that lag on older devices)

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision:** Single repository containing the Shopify theme and any custom scripts/integrations.

**Rationale:**
- Shopify themes follow a specific directory structure (layout/, sections/, snippets/, assets/, etc.)
- Solo founder benefits from single codebase for easier management
- All customizations (CSS porting, Liquid templates, JavaScript) live together
- Can use Shopify CLI for local development and deployment

**Structure:**
```
rangefit-shopify/
├── layout/           # Theme layouts (theme.liquid)
├── sections/         # Reusable sections (hero, testimonials, FAQ)
├── snippets/         # Reusable components (buttons, cards)
├── assets/           # CSS, JS, images (styles.css → theme.css.liquid)
├── templates/        # Page templates (index.json, product.json)
├── config/           # Theme settings
└── locales/          # Translations (en.default.json)
```

### Service Architecture: Hybrid - Shopify Hub + External SaaS Microservices

**Architecture Diagram (Conceptual):**

```
User → Shopify Site (Landing Page, Checkout, Member Dashboard)
         ↓
         ├→ Shopify Payments/Stripe (Subscriptions)
         ├→ ConvertKit (Email nurture, workout reminders)
         ├→ Zapier (Automation orchestration)
         ├→ Discord (Community)
         └→ Google Sheets (Analytics backup)
```

**Decision Rationale:**

1. **Shopify as Central Hub:**
   - Hosts landing pages (replaces Carrd, saves $19/year)
   - Manages subscriptions ($4.99 trial → $14.99/mo recurring)
   - Delivers 50% of workout content via member-only pages/blog posts
   - Handles payment processing (PCI compliant, no custom backend needed)

2. **ConvertKit for Email Delivery:**
   - Free tier up to 1,000 subscribers (fits $50 budget)
   - 7-day nurture sequence automation
   - Daily workout reminder emails with links back to Shopify
   - Form integrations for lead capture

3. **Zapier for Integration Glue:**
   - Free tier: 100 tasks/month (monitor closely, upgrade to $19.99 if needed)
   - Workflows:
     - New lead form submission → ConvertKit tag → Google Sheets log
     - Trial signup (Shopify order) → ConvertKit tag + Discord invite email
     - Subscription conversion → Update Google Sheets KPI dashboard
   - Manual backup process documented for failures

4. **Discord for Community:**
   - Free (critical for $50 budget)
   - Familiar to target audience (Sarah persona, 29, active online)
   - Auto-invite via Zapier webhook or email with invite link

5. **Google Sheets for Analytics:**
   - Free
   - Acts as backup data warehouse for KPIs
   - Solo founder can create charts/dashboards without BI tools
   - Zapier writes funnel events for weekly review

**Failure Isolation:**
- If Zapier fails: Manual Google Sheets updates + manual Discord invites (documented procedure)
- If ConvertKit fails: Shopify email notifications as fallback
- Each service owns its domain independently

### Testing Requirements: Manual Testing + User Acceptance

**Decision:** No automated testing for MVP. Weekly manual end-to-end testing with documented test plan.

**Rationale:**
- **Solo founder, no coding experience:** Writing automated tests requires technical skills and time
- **No-code stack:** Shopify themes, Zapier, ConvertKit don't easily support unit/integration testing
- **Scale appropriate:** At 50 members, manual testing is sustainable
- **Focus on speed:** MVP needs to launch in 5 weeks, automated testing would delay

**Testing Approach:**

1. **Weekly End-to-End Test (Manual Checklist):**
   - Load landing page on mobile (iPhone Safari, Android Chrome) - verify <3 sec load time
   - Submit lead capture form → Verify PDF delivery + ConvertKit email
   - Complete trial signup flow → Verify Shopify order + payment success
   - Check Discord invite email arrives within 5 minutes
   - Log into member dashboard → Verify workout pages accessible
   - Test subscription cancellation flow
   - Verify Google Sheets KPI log updated

2. **Beta User Acceptance Testing (Week 4):**
   - Recruit 5-10 beta users (friends, r/PCOS community members)
   - Provide test accounts (free trial)
   - Collect feedback via Typeform survey
   - Fix critical bugs before Week 5 public launch

3. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - **Mobile:** iOS Safari, Chrome Android (primary - 60% of traffic)
   - **Desktop:** Chrome, Safari (secondary)
   - **Not tested:** IE11, older browsers (not required per UI goals)

4. **A/B Testing (Post-MVP):**
   - ConvertKit: Test email subject lines (Week 6+)
   - Shopify: Test landing page headlines via manual variant creation
   - No sophisticated A/B testing tools (e.g., Optimizely) due to cost

**When to Add Automated Testing:**
- **Trigger:** When manual testing takes >2 hours/week (likely at 200+ members)
- **Recommendation:** Hire QA contractor or use low-code testing tool (e.g., Testim, Ghost Inspector ~$100/mo)

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**1. Shopify Plan Selection:**
- **Chosen Plan:** Shopify Basic ($39/mo after $1 trial)
- **Rationale:** Includes subscriptions app, custom domains, abandoned cart recovery
- **Alternative Considered:** Shopify Lite ($9/mo) - but lacks full website hosting, only buy buttons
- **Budget Impact:** $39/mo consumes most of $50 budget, leaves ~$10 for overages

**2. Shopify Theme Choice:**
- **Selected Theme:** Shopify Blank slate template
- **Rationale:** Minimal styling allows clean implementation of Legs on the Ground v2.0 design system without overriding existing CSS
- **Alternative Rejected:** Dawn (free, modern, fast) - but requires overriding more default styles
- **Alternative Rejected:** Premium theme like Impulse ($350 one-time) - upfront cost, still requires porting custom styles

**3. Workout Content Delivery (50% Shopify Implementation):**
- **Approach:** Use Shopify **Blog** feature to create "workout posts"
  - Each workout = blog post with: title, instructions, video embed (YouTube?), duration, intensity tags
  - Blog posts tagged for filtering (e.g., "beginner", "PCOS", "20-min")
  - Members access via Shopify customer account login (gated content)
- **Alternative:** Use Shopify **Pages** with metafields for structured workout data
  - **Pros:** More structured, better for future API
  - **Cons:** Requires metafield setup, more complex
- **Question for Architect:** Blog vs. Pages for workout library?

**4. Member Dashboard Implementation:**
- **Approach:** Custom Shopify **customer account page** showing:
  - Current subscription status (via Shopify subscription API)
  - Link to workout library (blog or pages)
  - Discord community button
  - Progress tracking (if feasible - may need app)
- **Challenge:** Shopify customer accounts have limited customization out-of-box
- **Solution:** Use customer account 2.0 (if available) or custom app for richer dashboard
- **Fallback:** Simple "My Account" page with links, no advanced tracking (add post-MVP)

**5. Energy Logging Implementation (FR10):**
- **MVP Approach:** Google Forms embedded in Shopify workout pages
  - User logs energy before/after workout
  - Form data goes to Google Sheets
  - Solo founder reviews manually for patterns
- **Post-MVP:** Shopify app for in-site logging with database storage
- **Rationale:** Google Forms is free, fast to implement, meets MVP needs

**6. Progress Tracking (FR9):**
- **MVP Approach:** Manual tracking via Google Sheets or simple checklist in Discord
- **Post-MVP:** Custom Shopify app or third-party progress tracker integration
- **Rationale:** Building custom progress tracking is complex, defer until after 50+ members validate need

**7. API Integrations:**
- **Shopify Admin API:** Used by Zapier for order events, customer tagging
- **ConvertKit API:** For tagging subscribers based on Shopify actions
- **Discord Webhook:** For sending auto-invites (or email with link if webhook fails)
- **Google Sheets API:** Via Zapier for logging funnel events

**8. Version Control & Deployment:**
- **Tool:** Git + GitHub repository (free)
- **Deployment:** Shopify CLI (`shopify theme push`) or Shopify GitHub integration
- **Workflow:** Develop locally → test on Shopify dev store → push to production theme

**9. Domain & SSL:**
- **Domain Registrar:** Namecheap (~$10/year for .com)
- **SSL:** Included free with Shopify
- **Email:** Use free Gmail or custom domain email via Zoho Mail (free tier, 5GB)

**10. Analytics & Monitoring:**
- **Shopify Analytics:** Built-in (traffic, conversion, sales)
- **Google Analytics 4:** Free, add tracking code to theme.liquid
- **Uptime Monitoring:** UptimeRobot (free tier, checks site every 5 min)
- **Error Monitoring:** None for MVP (manual bug reports from users)

**11. Performance Optimization:**
- **Images:** Use Shopify CDN, compress images before upload (TinyPNG)
- **CSS:** Minify theme.css.liquid in production
- **JavaScript:** Minimize custom JS, use Shopify's built-in scripts where possible
- **Lazy Loading:** Use native `loading="lazy"` attribute for images
- **Target:** <3 sec mobile load time (per NFR1)

**12. Accessibility:**
- **Standard:** WCAG AA (per UI Design Goals)
- **Implementation:** Use semantic HTML, aria labels, keyboard navigation
- **Testing:** Manual testing with keyboard, screen reader (NVDA/VoiceOver)
- **Shopify Benefit:** Blank slate theme has minimal styling, easy to implement accessible patterns

**13. Localization:**
- **MVP:** English only (US market)
- **Post-MVP:** Spanish translation (if market demand from brief's mentions of Latino community)
- **Shopify Support:** Built-in multi-language via theme locales

**14. Security & Compliance:**
- **PCI Compliance:** Handled by Shopify Payments/Stripe (never store credit cards)
- **GDPR:** ConvertKit handles email consent, Shopify privacy policy required
- **HIPAA:** Not pursuing HIPAA compliance (too complex/expensive for MVP)
- **Disclaimers:** "Not medical advice" on all workout content (per NFR14)
- **Terms of Service:** Use Shopify's template, customize for fitness/health context

**15. Backup & Disaster Recovery:**
- **Shopify Data:** Shopify maintains backups
- **Theme Code:** Git repository serves as backup
- **Customer Data:** Export CSV from Shopify weekly, store in Google Drive
- **Email List:** ConvertKit maintains backups
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 24 hours for theme restoration, 1 week for full data recovery

     - Opens Shopify payment update flow
     - Test: Update card, verify new card is charged on next billing

     - Otherwise, defer to post-MVP
   - **Cancel Subscription:**
     - Clear "Cancel Subscription" button/link

### Story 3.7: Build Subscription Analytics & Tracking Dashboard

**As a** solo founder,
**I want** real-time visibility into subscription metrics,
**so that** I can track progress toward MVP goals (50+ paying members, 15-20% conversion).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Google Sheet: "RangeFit Subscription Metrics"**
   - Sheet created with 3 tabs:
     - **Tab 1: "Trials"** - Log all trial signups
     - **Tab 2: "Conversions"** - Log trial→paid conversions
     - **Tab 3: "Churn"** - Log cancellations
   - Each tab includes columns:
     - Timestamp
     - Customer Email
     - Customer Name
     - Event Type (Trial Start, Conversion, Churn)
     - MRR Impact (e.g., +$14.99 for conversion, -$14.99 for churn)
     - Source (Landing Page, Email Campaign, etc. - for future attribution)

2. **Zapier Workflows for Metric Logging:**
   - **Workflow 1:** "Trial Start → Google Sheets"
     - Trigger: Shopify order for Trial product (financial status = paid)
     - Action: Add row to "Trials" tab
   - **Workflow 2:** "Trial → Paid Conversion → Google Sheets"
     - Trigger: Shopify subscription renewed (from trial to paid recurring)
     - Action: Add row to "Conversions" tab
     - **Challenge:** Shopify may not have direct trigger for this; may need webhook or manual tracking
     - **Alternative:** Track manually for MVP, automate post-MVP with custom app
   - **Workflow 3:** "Subscription Cancelled → Google Sheets"
     - Trigger: Shopify subscription cancelled
     - Action: Add row to "Churn" tab

3. **Google Sheet Formulas for KPIs:**
   - **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):**
     - Formula: `=SUMIF(Conversions!E:E, ">0", Conversions!E:E) - SUMIF(Churn!E:E, "<0", Churn!E:E)`
     - Target: $750+ by Day 90 (50 members × $14.99)
   - **Trial → Paid Conversion Rate:**
     - Formula: `=COUNTIF(Conversions!A:A, ">0") / COUNTIF(Trials!A:A, ">0")`
     - Target: 15-20%
   - **Active Subscribers:**
     - Formula: Count of conversions minus count of churn
     - Target: 50+ by Day 90
   - **Churn Rate (Monthly):**
     - Formula: (Churn this month / Active subscribers start of month) × 100
     - Target: <6% per brief

4. **Dashboard Visualization:**
   - Use Google Sheets charting to create:
     - Line chart: MRR over time (weekly)
     - Funnel chart: Leads → Free Plan → Trial → Paid
     - Pie chart: Active subscribers by plan (Premium vs Pro)
   - Dashboard tab at top of sheet for at-a-glance view

5. **Weekly Review Process:**
   - Founder reviews dashboard every Monday
   - Checks: MRR growth, conversion rate, churn rate
   - Documents findings in separate "Weekly Notes" tab
   - Adjusts strategy based on data (e.g., if conversion <15%, improve trial onboarding)

6. **Shopify Native Analytics:**
   - Review Shopify Admin analytics weekly:
     - Total sales
     - Subscription count
     - Traffic sources
   - Compare with Google Sheets data for accuracy

         <!-- Show full workout content -->
       {% else %}

     - Text: "Join RangeFit to access 21+ glucose-friendly workouts designed for your body."
     - CTA: "Start $4.99 Trial" (button linking to trial product)
     - Secondary CTA: "Already a member? Log in" (link to `/account/login`)
   - Paywall styled with Legs on the Ground `.card` design
   - Blur or hide workout content (not just hide with CSS - use Liquid logic to not render)

3. **Zapier Workflow: Tag Active Members (Option C Implementation):**
   - Workflow: "Shopify Order (Trial/Paid) → Tag Customer as 'active_member'"
   - Trigger: New order for subscription products
   - Action: Add tag "active_member" to Shopify customer
   - **Churn Handling:** When subscription cancels, remove "active_member" tag (Zapier workflow or manual cleanup)

4. **Workout Library Page Access:**
   - Blog index (`/blogs/workouts`) can be publicly visible (teaser) OR members-only
   - **Recommendation:** Show workout titles and thumbnails publicly, but lock individual workout content
   - Clicking workout from index checks access and shows paywall if not member

5. **Testing:**
   - **Test 1:** Log in as member with active subscription → Can access all workouts
   - **Test 2:** Log out → Workout pages show paywall
   - **Test 3:** Log in as customer without subscription → Show paywall
   - **Test 4:** Cancel subscription → Access removed (test after billing period ends)

6. **User Experience:**
   - Access checks load quickly (no performance impact per NFR2)
   - Error messages are friendly, not technical
   - Login redirect works smoothly (return to workout after login)

### Story 4.5: Implement Energy Logging System

**As a** member,
**I want** to easily log my energy levels before and after workouts,
**so that** RangeFit can learn my patterns and provide better recommendations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Google Form Created: "Energy Logging Form"**
   - Form fields:
     - Email Address (required, pre-populated if possible)
     - Workout Name (dropdown with 21 workout titles OR text input)
     - Pre-Workout Energy (dropdown: Low / Medium / High)
     - Post-Workout Energy (dropdown: Low / Medium / High)
     - Date (auto-filled with today's date or date picker)
     - Optional: Notes (text area for free-form feedback)
   - Form responses go to Google Sheet: "RangeFit Energy Logs"

2. **Energy Logging Form Embedded on Each Workout Page:**
   - Edit `templates/article.liquid` to include form embed at bottom of workout content
   - **Implementation:**
     - Embed Google Form iframe at bottom of workout post
     - OR create custom Shopify form that posts to Google Sheets via Zapier
   - Form is visible only to logged-in members (same access control as workout content)

3. **Energy Logging Button on Dashboard:**
   - Member dashboard (Story 4.3) includes "Log Energy" quick link
   - Link opens:
     - **Option A:** Standalone page with embedded form (`/pages/log-energy`)
     - **Option B:** Modal/popup with form
     - **Option C:** Direct link to Google Form (simpler for MVP)

4. **Google Sheet: "RangeFit Energy Logs"**
   - Columns: Timestamp, Email, Workout Name, Pre-Workout Energy, Post-Workout Energy, Date, Notes
   - Data automatically collected from Google Form
   - Founder can analyze weekly to identify patterns (manual for MVP)
   - **Post-MVP:** Use this data to train AI recommendation engine

5. **User Experience Optimization:**
   - Form is short and quick (<1 minute to complete)
   - Mobile-friendly (large tap targets, dropdown easy to select)
   - Confirmation message after submission: "Thanks! Your energy log helps us personalize your experience."
   - Optional: Incentivize logging with gamification (e.g., "Log 7 days in a row for a badge!") - defer to post-MVP

6. **Progress Tracking Integration (FR9 Implementation):**
   - **MVP Approach (Manual):**
     - Founder reviews Google Sheets weekly
     - Manually counts completed workouts per member (based on energy logs)
     - Updates dashboard stats manually OR uses simple formula
   - **Alternative (Semi-Automated):**
     - Zapier workflow: Google Form submission → Update Google Sheets "Member Progress" tab
     - Dashboard pulls workout count from Google Sheets via Shopify metafields or manual update
   - **Post-MVP:** Database-driven progress tracking with automatic dashboard updates

7. **Testing:**
   - Submit 10 test energy logs via embedded form
   - Verify all 10 appear in Google Sheet correctly
   - Verify form is accessible on mobile (workout pages and dashboard)
   - Verify form validation works (required fields enforced)

### Story 4.6: Set Up Discord Community and Automated Invites

**As a** trial or paid member,
**I want** to automatically receive a Discord invite when I sign up,
**so that** I can join the community and connect with others.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Discord Server Created:**
   - Server name: "RangeFit Community" or "RangeFit - Glucose Fitness"
   - Server icon: RangeFit logo
   - Server description: "The supportive community for people managing blood sugar through fitness. Share wins, ask questions, and belong."

2. **Discord Channels Created:**
   - **#welcome:** Auto-welcome message for new members, rules, intro prompts
   - **#wins:** Members share successes, PRs, energy improvements
   - **#questions:** Ask anything about workouts, glucose, PCOS, etc.
   - **#pcos-crew:** Dedicated channel for PCOS community (Sarah persona focus)
   - **#accountability:** Daily check-ins, workout logs, accountability partners
   - **#off-topic:** General chat, non-fitness topics
   - **#announcements:** Founder posts updates, new workouts, events (read-only for members)

3. **Discord Roles Created:**
   - **@Trial Member:** Auto-assigned to trial users
   - **@Premium Member:** Auto-assigned to paid recurring members
   - **@Pro Member:** Auto-assigned to Pro tier members (future)
   - **@Founder:** Jay's role
   - **@Moderator:** For future community managers (if hired)

4. **Discord Server Settings:**
   - Verification level: Low (email verification)
   - Member screening: Optional welcome screen with rules acceptance
   - Permissions: Members can post in all channels except #announcements
   - Invite link expiration: Never (or 7 days with unlimited uses)

5. **Discord Invite Automation (FR14):**

   **Option A: Email-Based Invite (Simpler for MVP)**
   - ConvertKit "Trial Welcome" email (Epic 3, Story 3.5, Email 1) includes Discord invite link
   - Discord permanent invite link generated: `https://discord.gg/XXXXX`
   - Email includes:
     - Heading: "Join Your Community"
     - Text: "Connect with 2,000+ members managing blood sugar through fitness"
     - Button: "Join Discord" (links to invite)
     - Instructions: "Click to join, create Discord account if needed, introduce yourself in #welcome"
   - Invite link tested (works, doesn't expire, auto-assigns role if possible)

   **Option B: Zapier Webhook to Discord (Advanced, Optional)**
   - Zapier workflow: "Shopify Order → Discord Invite via Webhook"
   - Trigger: New subscription order
   - Action: Send Discord invite via webhook OR add member to Discord server (requires Discord API integration)
   - **Challenge:** Discord doesn't have native "add member" API without OAuth; email invite is simpler
   - **Recommendation:** Use Option A for MVP, defer Option B to post-MVP

6. **Discord Widget on Dashboard (FR15):**
   - Member dashboard (Story 4.3, Section E) includes Discord widget
   - **Option 1:** Embed Discord server widget (iframe showing online members):
     ```html
     <iframe src="https://discord.com/widget?id=SERVER_ID&theme=light"
             width="350" height="500" frameborder="0"
             sandbox="allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts">
     </iframe>
     ```
   - **Option 2:** Static section with "Join Discord" button (simpler, faster load)
   - Widget/section is prominently displayed (not buried at bottom)

7. **Community Seeding:**
   - Founder posts first messages in each channel (set welcoming tone)
   - Beta testers invited to join and seed activity (Week 4-5)
   - First 10-20 members receive extra attention (founder engagement to build culture)

8. **Community Moderation Plan:**
   - Founder moderates for MVP (no hired mods yet)
   - Rules posted in #welcome:
     - Be kind and supportive
     - No spam or self-promotion
     - Respect privacy (no sharing others' health info)
     - Not medical advice (consult your doctor)
   - Discord "AutoMod" enabled to filter spam/profanity

9. **Testing:**
   - Complete trial purchase as test user
   - Verify Discord invite link is received in welcome email within 5 minutes (NFR3)
   - Click invite link, verify Discord server loads
   - Join server, verify role is assigned (if automated) or can be manually assigned
   - Test Discord widget on dashboard (loads correctly, shows online members)
