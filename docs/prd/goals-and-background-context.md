# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Launch an affordable, AI-powered glucose-aware fitness platform via Shopify that serves the underserved mainstream market at $14.99/month
- Validate the content-led growth funnel (TikTok → Free lead magnet → Email nurture → Trial → Subscription) with 50+ paying members by Day 90
- Establish RangeFit as the "Everyman" alternative with Unity positioning (community-first, relatable, accessible)
- Achieve 15-20% trial-to-paid conversion and 18-24% D30 retention proving product-market fit
- Build an engaged Discord community of 100+ members demonstrating Unity persuasion effectiveness
- Enable solo-founder operation through no-code/low-code automation stack under $50/month budget
- Create a complete trial experience delivery system (email-based workouts + community access) without requiring a mobile app
- Prove organic TikTok content can drive 500+ free plan downloads in first 60 days

## Background Context

The glucose-aware fitness market is currently polarized between prohibitively expensive clinical solutions ($129-400/month requiring CGM devices) and generic fitness apps that completely ignore blood sugar patterns. 30+ million Americans managing pre-diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and PCOS face confusion, energy crashes, and lack of affordable guidance on exercise that works with their metabolic challenges. No competitor has claimed the accessible, community-first "people like us" positioning that resonates with budget-conscious individuals.

RangeFit addresses this gap through a Shopify-based subscription business that delivers adaptive workout personalization via email and Discord at 10x lower cost than competitors. The MVP leverages existing SaaS tools (ConvertKit, Shopify, Discord, Zapier) to validate the business model before investing in custom app development. By targeting Sarah Chen—a 29-year-old teacher with PCOS earning $52K/year—RangeFit can capture the underserved mainstream market through relatable TikTok content, low-friction $4.99 trials, and strong community belonging rather than clinical intimidation.
