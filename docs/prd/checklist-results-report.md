## Recommendations

### For Product Manager:
1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** PRD is comprehensive and ready for architecture phase
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Create user flow diagrams (or delegate to UX Expert in Next Steps)
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Document data retention policy (1-page addendum to PRD)

### For Architect:
1. **Validate Shopify Blank slate CSS porting effort** - Review `docs/styles.css` (2000 lines), confirm 4-6 hour estimate
2. **Test Shopify blog for workout content** - Create 2-3 sample workout posts, assess usability
3. **Prototype member-only access control** - Test Liquid logic or install Locksmith app, document approach
4. **Recommend Discord invite method** - Email-based (simplest) vs. webhook (automated), document choice

### For UX Expert:
1. **Create user flow diagrams** for main funnel, member loop, and subscription management
2. **Review Legs on the Ground design system** (`docs/styles.css`, `docs/index.html`) and confirm design direction
3. **Create wireframes** for member dashboard, workout library grid, and trial product page
