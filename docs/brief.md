# Project Brief: RangeFit

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Author:** Jay Singh
**Status:** Pre-Launch / Validation Phase

---

## Executive Summary

**RangeFit** is an affordable, AI-powered glucose-aware fitness platform positioned as the "Everyman" alternative in a market dominated by expensive, medicalized solutions. For just $14.99/month (vs. $129-139/month competitors), RangeFit delivers adaptive workout personalization for everyday people managing pre-diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and PCOS—without requiring expensive CGM devices or clinical programs.

**The Market Gap:** Existing solutions are either prohibitively expensive ($129-400/month), overly clinical and intimidating, or completely ignore glucose awareness. No competitor has claimed the accessible, community-first "people like us" positioning.

**The Opportunity:** Leverage Unity persuasion (community belonging), affordable pricing, and AI personalization to capture the underserved mainstream market of 30+ million Americans managing insulin resistance who can't afford premium solutions.

**Go-to-Market Strategy:** Content-led growth via TikTok → Free lead magnet → Email nurture → $4.99 trial → $14.99/month subscription with strong community engagement.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Millions of people managing blood sugar issues face a frustrating reality:

**The Clinical Problem:**
- 30+ million Americans have pre-diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, or PCOS with insulin resistance
- Exercise is critical for glucose management, yet generic fitness apps ignore blood sugar patterns
- Wrong workout timing or intensity can spike or crash blood sugar, causing confusion and discouragement

**The Accessibility Problem:**
- Premium glucose-aware solutions (Signos, Levels, Nutrisense) cost $129-400/month—excluding 95% of the market
- These apps require expensive CGM devices and position themselves as elite wellness optimization tools
- Budget-conscious individuals (teachers, service workers, students) have no accessible alternative

**The Community Problem:**
- Existing solutions position users as patients or optimization seekers, not as "people like us"
- No mainstream fitness brand has created belonging and identity around glucose-aware fitness
- Users feel isolated—"no one around me understands PCOS and insulin resistance"

### Impact of the Problem

**For Individuals:**
- Persistent 3pm energy crashes affecting work and life quality
- Wasted money on fitness apps that don't work for their body
- Confusion about what exercise is "safe" and effective
- Social isolation and lack of support from peers who understand

**Market Impact:**
- $50+ billion diabetes management market, but fitness solutions are fragmented
- High churn in generic fitness apps for metabolically challenged users
- Growing awareness of glucose health via TikTok/social media, but no affordable entry point

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Competitor | Why It Fails |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Signos** ($129-139/mo) | Too expensive for mainstream market; weight-loss focused; weak community |
| **Levels/Nutrisense** ($250-400/mo) | Elite positioning excludes everyday people; requires CGM commitment |
| **January AI** (~$30-50/mo) | No workout adaptation; overly clinical; missing lifestyle/community |
| **GlucoseZone** ($20-40/mo) | Rule-based (not AI); static programs; diabetes-only positioning |
| **Fitbod/Freeletics** ($10-15/mo) | Zero glucose awareness; not health-condition focused |

**The Gap:** No one has built an affordable, AI-powered, community-first glucose fitness solution positioned for everyday people.

### Urgency and Importance

**Why Now:**
1. **Media Bubble:** Glucose-aware content is trending on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube
2. **CGM Availability:** Dexcom Stelo OTC launch makes glucose monitoring mainstream topic
3. **Economic Pressure:** Inflation drives demand for affordable health solutions
4. **AI Accessibility:** No-code AI tools make personalization feasible at low cost
5. **Community Hunger:** Post-pandemic demand for belonging and shared identity in health

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

**RangeFit delivers affordable AI-powered glucose-aware fitness coaching with community support, positioned as "fitness for people like us" rather than clinical or elite.**

**The Experience:**
1. **Discover** via relatable TikTok content (TOFU): "POV: You have PCOS and every fitness app makes you crash"
2. **Try** free 7-day glucose-friendly workout plan (lead magnet)
3. **Engage** with 7-day email nurture sequence (education + social proof)
4. **Convert** to $4.99 trial (7 days, full access)
5. **Belong** to community and AI-personalized experience at $14.99/month
6. **Upgrade** to Pro tier ($24.99/mo) for advanced analytics and coaching calls

### Key Differentiators

**1. Adaptive AI Personalization**
- Workouts learn from user's glucose patterns and energy levels (not static rules)
- No CGM required—works with manual glucose logs or energy tracking
- Trained on everyday people's data, not elite athletes or clinical trials

**2. Budget Pricing**
- $14.99/month vs. $129-139/month (10x more affordable than Signos)
- Low-friction $4.99 trial removes risk
- No expensive hardware required

**3. Everyman Positioning & Unity**
- First "people like us" brand in glucose fitness space
- Community-first: Discord with 2,000+ target members
- Relatable content: lifestyle hooks, not clinical intimidation
- Celebrates progress, not perfection

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

**Market Validation:**
- Competitor content analysis shows lifestyle hooks outperform clinical content in virality
- Brainstorming session mapped 100+ touchpoints proving funnel completeness
- Customer discovery validated Sarah persona (29-year-old teacher with PCOS, $52K income)

**Persuasion Strategy:**
- Unity (community belonging) is almost entirely missing from competitor positioning
- Combining Unity + Social Proof + Authority creates defensible moat
- Price-sensitive market responds to 10x cost reduction

**Technical Feasibility:**
- MVP can start with rule-based recommendations, transition to ML
- No-code tools (Bubble, Glide) enable app development without engineering team
- Automation stack (Zapier, ConvertKit, Shopify) proven in brainstorming session

### High-Level Vision

**Short-term (90 days):** Validate funnel with 50+ paying members, prove trial→paid conversion
**Medium-term (1 year):** Scale to 500+ members via organic content, launch Pro tier
**Long-term (2-3 years):** Mobile app, CGM integration, B2B corporate wellness, 5,000+ members

### Out of Scope for MVP

**Explicitly NOT included in Phase 1 (first 90 days):**

- **Mobile App:** Use email + Discord for content delivery
  - *Why delayed:* Expensive, time-consuming; can validate with simpler delivery
  - *When to add:* After 100+ paying members prove retention

- **Advanced AI Personalization:** Start with rule-based recommendations
  - *Why delayed:* ML requires data; can fake it with smart rules initially
  - *When to add:* After collecting 60+ days of user workout/energy data

- **WhatsApp Integration:** Email + Discord sufficient for trial phase
  - *Why delayed:* Adds complexity; need to prove email+Discord works first
  - *When to add:* After 50+ members request it or engagement drops

- **CGM Integration:** Manual glucose logging is sufficient
  - *Why delayed:* API complexity, not all users have CGM
  - *When to add:* When 30%+ users request it or partner opportunity arises

- **Pro Tier Features:** Focus on proving Premium tier works first
  - *Why delayed:* Need baseline to know what "advanced" means
  - *When to add:* After 60+ days of member data, top 10 power users identified

- **Paid Ads:** Organic-only for Phase 1
  - *Why delayed:* Need to prove organic conversion first to inform ad strategy
  - *When to add:* After 200+ free downloads prove funnel, then test $10-20/day

### MVP Success Criteria

**The MVP is successful if by Day 90:**

✅ 50+ active paying members ($750+ MRR)

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

**Target Platforms:**
- Web-responsive landing pages (Carrd, mobile-optimized)
- Email (mobile-first design, all clients supported)
- Discord (iOS, Android, desktop apps)
- Future: Native mobile app (iOS + Android via Bubble or custom development)

**Browser/OS Support:**
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge - last 2 versions)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- No IE11 support required

**Performance Requirements:**
- Landing page load time: <3 seconds (mobile)
- Email delivery: <2 minutes after trigger
- Zapier automation execution: <5 minutes per workflow
- Discord invite: Instant on payment success

### Technology Preferences

**Frontend:**
- Landing pages: Carrd (no-code, $19/year)
- Future app: Bubble.io (no-code) or Glide (sheets-to-app)
- Rationale: Speed over customization; solo-founder feasible

**Backend:**
- Email: ConvertKit (free tier, creator-focused)
- Payments: Shopify + Stripe (subscription management)
- Automation: Zapier (free tier, upgrade as needed)
- Rationale: Proven stack from brainstorming session, minimal setup

**Database:**
- Google Sheets (KPI tracking, user data backup)
- Future: Bubble.io database or Airtable for app
- Rationale: Accessible, visual, no SQL required

**Hosting/Infrastructure:**
- Carrd (hosted landing pages)
- ConvertKit (hosted email)
- Shopify (hosted checkout)
- Discord (hosted community)
- Total cost: <$50/month
- Rationale: Fully managed, no DevOps required

### Architecture Considerations

**Repository Structure:**
- Not applicable (no-code stack for MVP)
- Future: Monorepo if building custom app (all code in one repo)

**Service Architecture:**
- Microservices via SaaS integrations (Zapier connects discrete tools)
- Each tool owns its domain (ConvertKit = email, Shopify = payments, etc.)
- Failure isolation: If Zapier fails, manual backup process exists

**Integration Requirements:**
- Zapier connects: Carrd form → ConvertKit → Shopify → Discord → Google Sheets
- Webhooks: Shopify order events trigger Zapier workflows
- APIs: ConvertKit API for tagging, Stripe API for payment management
- Backup: Manual Google Sheet updates if automation fails

**Security/Compliance:**
- PCI compliance: Handled by Stripe (never touch credit cards)
- GDPR/Privacy: ConvertKit handles email compliance, privacy policy required
- Health data: No PHI collected (users self-report, not medical records)
- Terms of Service: Required disclaimer ("not medical advice, consult doctor")

**Testing Requirements:**
- Manual testing: Weekly end-to-end test of full funnel (form → email → payment → Discord)
- User acceptance: Beta test with 5-10 volunteers before public launch
- A/B testing: ConvertKit for email subject lines, Carrd for landing page headlines
- No automated testing required for MVP (manual is sufficient at this scale)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Budget:**
- **Total available:** <$200/month for tools + ads
- **MVP Phase (first 90 days):** <$50/month (tools only, no ads)
- **Breakdown:** Carrd ($1.58/mo), ConvertKit (free→$29), Zapier (free→$29), Shopify (~$39)
- **Implication:** Must prove organic funnel before spending on ads

**Timeline:**
- **MVP launch target:** Week 5 (35 days from start)
- **Week 1:** Setup infrastructure (Carrd, ConvertKit, Shopify, Discord, Zapier)
- **Week 2:** Create lead magnet PDF, launch landing page, film 10 TikTok videos
- **Week 3:** Build trial system, test end-to-end funnel
- **Week 4:** Beta test with 5-10 volunteers, iterate
- **Week 5:** Public launch to TikTok audience
- **Implication:** Aggressive timeline requires focused execution, no scope creep

**Resources:**
- **Team:** Solo founder (Jay) - all roles
- **Time commitment:** 30-40 hours/week
- **Skills:** Marketing/content strong, technical requires no-code tools
- **Implication:** Must use pre-built tools, cannot build custom software

**Technical:**
- **No coding experience:** Must rely on no-code/low-code tools
- **No CGM device:** Cannot test CGM integration personally
- **No ML expertise:** Cannot build true AI initially (start rule-based)
- **Implication:** MVP focuses on content, community, and simple automation

### Key Assumptions

**Market Assumptions:**
1. **Sarah persona exists at scale:** 30+ million Americans with pre-diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, or PCOS
   - *Validation plan:* Survey 50 people in r/PCOS, r/diabetes about pain points and willingness to pay

2. **$14.99/month is acceptable price point:** 10x cheaper than Signos creates sufficient value perception
   - *Validation plan:* Survey asks "How much would you pay?" - target 60%+ say $10-20/month

3. **Lifestyle content outperforms clinical:** TikTok/Instagram engagement higher with relatable hooks
   - *Validation plan:* A/B test 10 videos (5 lifestyle, 5 clinical), measure CTR to landing page

**Product Assumptions:**
4. **Email + Discord delivery is sufficient for trial:** Don't need app to test trial→paid conversion
   - *Validation plan:* First 50 trial users - if <10% request app, assumption holds

5. **Manual glucose logging works:** Users will log without CGM device
   - *Validation plan:* Trial users complete 2+ logs per week, or energy tracking alone suffices

6. **AI can be faked with rules initially:** "If low energy → suggest light workout" feels personalized enough
   - *Validation plan:* Survey trial users - if 70%+ say "workouts felt personalized", assumption holds

**Funnel Assumptions:**
7. **Free lead magnet converts 15-20% to trial:** 7-day plan is compelling enough bridge
   - *Validation plan:* Track first 100 downloads, measure conversion after 7-day nurture

8. **$4.99 trial converts 15-20% to $14.99/mo paid:** Low-friction trial removes objection
   - *Validation plan:* First 50 trial users, measure Day 7 conversion rate

9. **Unity positioning resonates:** Community belonging is motivating enough to drive retention
   - *Validation plan:* Discord engagement 30%+ monthly, NPS >40 at 90 days

**Operational Assumptions:**
10. **Zapier automation is reliable enough:** 95%+ uptime with manual backup acceptable
    - *Validation plan:* Monitor Zapier error notifications, test backup process weekly

11. **Solo founder can handle 50 members:** Customer support, content creation, community management feasible
    - *Validation plan:* Time tracking - if >50 hours/week consistently, need to hire VA

12. **Organic TikTok provides sufficient traffic:** No paid ads required for MVP
    - *Validation plan:* 500+ free plan downloads in 60 days from organic only

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **AI doesn't work without CGM data** | Medium | High | Start with manual logging + "directional" guidance vs. precise predictions; 70% accuracy threshold |
| **Can't compete with Signos marketing budget** | High | Medium | Lean into organic (TikTok, community) and Unity (they lack this); avoid competing on ads |
| **Regulatory issues (FDA, medical claims)** | Low | High | Avoid medical claims, position as "fitness guidance" not "diabetes treatment"; legal review of copy |
| **Community doesn't engage (Unity fails)** | Medium | High | Seed with engaged beta users, hire community manager by Month 3, host weekly events |
| **Trial conversion <15%** | Medium | High | Extend trial to 14 days, add in-trial touchpoints, increase social proof |
| **Churn >6%/month** | Medium | High | Double down on habit formation in first 30 days, improve onboarding, add challenges |
| **Organic traffic insufficient** | Medium | Medium | Test $10-20/day TikTok ads by Week 6 if downloads <50/week; iterate content hooks |
| **Solo founder burnout** | High | High | Time-box to 40 hours/week max, hire VA at 50+ members for support/scheduling |
| **Content creation bottleneck** | Medium | Medium | Batch film 20+ videos in one session, use Metricool to schedule 4 weeks ahead |
| **Zapier failures lose customers** | Low | Medium | Monitor daily, manual backup process documented, upgrade to paid tier by Week 4 |

### Open Questions

**Product Questions:**

3. **Should we focus on PCOS-only or multi-condition from day 1?**
   - *Impact:* Affects content strategy and positioning
   - *Decision by:* Week 1 (after persona survey - if 70%+ are PCOS, niche down)

4. **Do we need CGM integration, or is manual logging sufficient?**
   - *Impact:* Development complexity and roadmap priority
   - *Decision by:* Week 6 (survey trial users - if 40%+ request CGM, prioritize)

5. **What's realistic CAC for TikTok ads in health/fitness?**
   - *Impact:* Determines when to add paid ads and budget allocation
   - *Decision by:* Week 6 (research competitor ad spend, test $10/day)

**Market Questions:**
6. **Will customers trust a solo founder vs. team/brand?**
   - *Impact:* Positioning and "about" page strategy
   - *Decision by:* Week 1 (test personal founder story vs. brand story in landing page)

7. **Is $4.99 trial too low (cheapens brand) or perfect (removes friction)?**
   - *Impact:* Pricing strategy and perceived value
   - *Decision by:* Week 4 (measure trial→paid conversion - if >25%, may be underpriced)

8. **Will Discord feel too "gamer-y" for 40+ audience?**
   - *Impact:* Community platform choice
   - *Decision by:* Week 6 (if 20%+ of members are 40+ and complain, switch to Circle)

**Operational Questions:**
9. **At what member count do we need to hire first VA/contractor?**
   - *Impact:* Budget and time allocation
   - *Decision by:* Week 8 (if support + community takes >15 hours/week, hire)

10. **Should we white-label or brand the community?**
    - *Impact:* Discord setup and onboarding flow
    - *Decision by:* Week 3 (test branded vs. unbranded invite copy)

### Areas Needing Further Research

**Before MVP Launch:**
- [ ] Legal review of landing page copy and disclaimers (ensure FDA/FTC compliance)
- [ ] Competitor pricing audit update (verify Signos still $129-139/mo, no price drops)
- [ ] Discord vs. Circle cost-benefit analysis (when to switch platforms)

**During MVP Phase:**
- [ ] Beta user interviews (10+ users) - identify unexpected pain points
- [ ] Content hook testing (identify which TikTok hooks drive highest CTR)
- [ ] Retention analysis (why do users churn - interview churned users)

**Post-MVP:**

## Appendices

### A. Research Summary

**Market Research Highlights:**
- Competitive landscape analyzed: Signos, January AI, Nutrisense, Levels, GlucoseZone, Fitbod
- No competitor claims "Everyman" positioning - all are Hero, Sage, Ruler, or Caregiver archetypes
- Unity persuasion (community belonging) is almost entirely missing from competitor marketing
- Price gap: $10-15/mo (generic fitness) vs. $129-400/mo (glucose-aware) - RangeFit fills the gap

**Customer Discovery Findings:**
- Sarah persona validated via TikTok content engagement (PCOS hashtags have millions of views)
- Brainstorming session mapped 100+ touchpoints from cold traffic to recurring revenue
- Email sequence tested persuasion hierarchy: Unity > Social Proof > Authority
- Funnel architecture proven viable via reverse engineering from payment back to acquisition

**Content Analysis:**
- Lifestyle hooks ("POV: Low blood sugar at HomeGoods") outperform clinical content in virality
- Educational content builds authority in MOFU (middle of funnel)
- Social proof (testimonials) is critical at BOFU (decision point)
- TikTok/Instagram preferred by Sarah persona over YouTube/blog for discovery

### B. Stakeholder Input

**Founder Vision (Jay Singh):**
- Personal motivation: Frustration with expensive, inaccessible glucose-aware solutions
- Business goal: Build sustainable $10K+ MRR business within 12 months
- Lifestyle goal: Maintain solo founder autonomy, avoid VC funding
- Impact goal: Help 1,000+ people improve energy and glucose through affordable fitness

**Beta Tester Feedback (from future validation):**
- *To be collected during Week 4 beta testing*
- *Document pain points, feature requests, and testimonials here*

### PM Handoff

**Context for PRD Development:**

This Project Brief provides the full foundation for RangeFit. The next step is to create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) that translates this vision into specific features, user stories, and technical specifications.

**Key inputs for PRD:**
- Target users: Sarah Chen (primary) - PCOS, teacher, $52K income, budget-conscious
- MVP scope: Email-based trial delivery, no app required initially
- Success metrics: 50+ paying members, 15-20% conversion, 18-24% retention by Day 90
- Technical constraints: No-code stack, solo founder, <$50/month budget
- Differentiators: Unity (community), AI (rule-based initially), Affordable ($14.99/mo)

**PRD should focus on:**
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Landing page, email funnel, trial system, Discord community, automation
2. **Phase 2 (Post-MVP):** Mobile app, AI personalization, Pro tier, referral program
3. **User stories** for each epic, sequenced logically with acceptance criteria
4. **Non-functional requirements:** Performance, security, privacy, compliance
5. **Technical architecture:** Integration workflows, data flow, failure handling

**When ready to proceed:** Use the `/pm` agent command to start PRD creation in interactive mode, or review this brief and provide feedback for refinement.
