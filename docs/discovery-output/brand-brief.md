# Customer Discovery — Brand Brief (Draft)

## Basics
- Working name: RangeFit (placeholder)
- 1‑liner: CGM/IR‑aware AI fitness coach for T1D, T2D, pre‑diabetic, and PCOS/IR; one clear plan/day for safe, consistent progress.

## Archetype
- Primary archetype: Caregiver (safety, support) + Hero (achievement)
- Why: Users want progress without scary episodes; the brand must both protect and empower.

## Positioning Statement
For active adults with diabetes or insulin resistance who want to train safely and consistently, RangeFit is an AI fitness coach that adapts workouts and meals to real‑time glucose trends/variability and metabolic context. Unlike general fitness apps or diabetes loggers, we integrate device data and safety thresholds to drive plans and nudges, not just charts.

## Value Proposition
- Core outcomes:
  - T1D/T2D: safer training days, fewer symptomatic lows, one clear plan/day
  - Pre‑diabetic/IR/PCOS: stable energy, low‑glycemic meals, sustainable strength/weight progress

- Scarcity: early access to Pro features (when approved), limited cohort challenges
- Authority: advisory council; published safety guidelines; transparent logic
- Consistency: streaks, micro‑commitments, weekly wins
- Liking: authentic founder story; relatable voice
- Social Proof: athlete/client stories; community highlights
- Unity: “diabetic athletes” and “PCOS‑friendly strength” communities
