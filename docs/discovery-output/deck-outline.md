# Customer Discovery — Presentation Deck Outline (Draft)

Reference templates: docs/templates/customer-discovery/08-presentation-outline-template.md

## Slide 1 — Title & Topic
- Headline: RangeFit — Safety‑Aware AI Coaching for Diabetes & PCOS/IR
- Subhead: Media bubble shows diabetic athletes, CGM training tips, PCOS‑friendly strength, and IR‑friendly meals with strong engagement
- Assets: [Add 3–5 screenshots/links from TikTok/YouTube/IG/Reddit]
- Takeaway: Large, engaged niches lack CGM/IR‑aware strength coaching with simple daily guidance

## Slide 2 — Competitive Landscape Table (Condensed)
- Headline: Plans vs. Data — No One Bridges Safety‑Aware Training

| Competitor | Niche | Primary Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Fitbod | Strength planner | No glucose/IR context |
| Freeletics | AI coach | Not diabetes‑aware |
| MySugr | Diabetes logger | No prescriptive training |
| Dexcom/LibreView | Device ecosystem | Not prescriptive |
| Supersapiens/Levels | Metabolic insights | Limited prescriptive workouts/strength |

- Takeaway: Fitness excels at plans; diabetes/metabolic excels at data; neither delivers CGM/IR‑aware strength periodization

## Slide 3 — Content Audit Highlights
- Headline: Hooks and CTAs That Land (and Miss)
- Best examples (2–3): [Add links/screens]
- What worked: clear transformations, simple checklists, authentic voice
- What didn’t: generic nutrition claims, dense charts without action
- Takeaway: Short, specific, safety‑oriented tips outperform broad claims

## Slide 4 — Gap Analysis
- Headline: Underserved Segments + Weak Stages
- Underserved: T1D lifters; T2D adults; pre‑diabetics; women with PCOS/IR
- Weak stages: MOFU education on safety logic; BOFU proof/testimonials; Post‑purchase onboarding/community
- Takeaway: A safety‑aware, PCOS/IR‑friendly strength wedge is open

## Slide 5 — Opportunity Statement
- Headline: One‑Sentence Opportunity
- Statement: For active adults with diabetes or insulin resistance, we will provide safe, consistent progress by adapting workouts and low‑glycemic meals to daily glucose/metabolic context, unlike fitness apps that ignore glucose and tracking apps that stop at logging.
- Why now: CGM adoption; short‑form fitness education; AI personalization expectations

## Slide 6 — Brand Brief (Visual)
- Headline: Caregiver + Hero Archetype; Clear Outcomes
- Archetype/Positioning/Value prop: Safety‑aware strength and IR‑friendly meals; one plan/day; fewer scary episodes; steady energy
- Persuasion levers: Authority, Consistency, Unity, Reciprocity, Social Proof, Liking
- Differentiators: CGM‑aware periodization; PCOS/IR defaults; daily clarity with adaptive nudges

## Slide 7 — Persona (Profile)
- Headline: PCOS/IR “Maya” (32) — Sustainable Strength, Stable Energy
- Snapshot: Bio, JTBD, pains (energy dips, conflicting advice), gains (steady progress, confidence), proof needed (simple rules, success stories)
- Link: docs/discovery-output/personas-pcos.md

## Slide 8 — Customer Journey Map
- Headline: TOFU → MOFU → BOFU → Post
- TOFU: Shorts with sugar‑safe/PCOS‑friendly tips → CTA: free 7‑day plan
- MOFU: Lead magnet + 5‑email method explainer → CTA: 14‑day trial
- BOFU: Offer page with safety logic + testimonials → CTA: Start trial
- Post: Onboarding to daily plan; community challenges; Pro upsell when eligible
- Link: docs/discovery-output/journey.md

## Slide 9 — Success Metrics & KPIs
- Headline: 30/60/90 Targets Aligned to BRD
- Awareness: CTR to LP 2%/3%/4%
- Consideration: Opt‑ins 25%/30%/35%; email CTR 8%/10%/12%
- Conversion: LP CVR 6%/8%/10%; trial→paid 7%/9%/12%
- Post‑purchase: D1/D7/D30 near 55/30/15; plan adherence ≥ 60%
- Link: docs/discovery-output/kpis-30-60-90.md

## Slide 10 — Closing Takeaway
- Headline: Wedge First, Then Expand
- The bet: Win T1D lifter and PCOS/IR wedges with safety‑aware strength → expand into broader segments as integrations mature
- Next steps: Evidence capture, competitor cards, lead magnet build, tracking plan

## Optional Slide 11 — Risks & Mitigations
- Regulatory ambiguity → wellness positioning; no clinical claims; disclaimers
- Device access → HealthKit/Google Fit first; apply to Dexcom/Abbott
- Privacy/security → SOC2 path; HIPAA‑aligned controls where appropriate

## Optional Slide 12 — Experiment Backlog
- LP A/B (safety logic explainer)
- Lead magnet variants (T1D vs. PCOS)
- Email sequence tests (order, proof density)
- TOFU hooks (checklist vs. transformation)
