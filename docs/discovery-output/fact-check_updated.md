# Discovery Output — Updated Version (Fact-Checked)

## Key Revisions Applied

### 1. Competitive Landscape
- **Fitbod** → Confirmed: No glucose/IR context. Strength-only personalization.
- **Freeletics** → Confirmed: AI coach, not diabetes-aware.
- **MySugr** → Confirmed: Logs diabetes data, no prescriptive training.
- **Dexcom/LibreView** → Confirmed: Provide glucose data, not training plans.
- **Supersapiens/Levels** → Confirmed: Metabolic insights, no structured strength programming.
- **Addition:** Note that *GlucoseZone* exists with exercise videos for diabetics, but does not deliver adaptive strength periodization.

**Revision applied:** Competitive landscape slides now clarify that no app delivers “CGM-aware strength periodization,” and include a footnote citing niche offerings like GlucoseZone (for credibility).

### 2. CGM Adoption (Why Now)
**Original:** “CGM adoption (U.S. T1D Exchange registry ~95% CGM use in 2025; 2022 multicenter data show higher youth vs. lower adult CGM use).”

**Revised:** “CGM adoption is rising — *Registry data* (T1D Exchange, 2025) show ~95% CGM use among participants. EMR data from 26 U.S. centers (T1DX-QI, 2022) confirm adoption disparities: ~64% in youth vs. ~46% in adults. In Type 2 diabetes, ~13% used CGM in 2021 (Mayberry et al., JGIM 2023).”

---

### 3. Personas — PCOS/IR
**Addition:** In persona descriptions for women with PCOS/IR, add prevalence reference: *“PCOS affects ~6–12% of U.S. women of reproductive age (CDC). Many report challenges with weight, insulin resistance, and sustainable exercise.”*

---

### 4. KPIs (30/60/90)
**Original:** “Retention (D1/D7/D30) — target near BRD (55/30/15) [ambitious].”

**Revised:** “Retention (D1/D7/D30) — target near BRD (55/30/15) [aspirational; industry benchmarks show median D30 at 3–6%].”

**Addition:** For email and conversion KPIs, explicitly note: *“Benchmarks: average email CTR ~2–5% (Salesforce); landing page conversions ~5–6% (Landingi). Our targets (e.g. email CTR 8–12%, conversion 6–10%) are aspirational, aiming for top-tier performance.”*

---

### 5. Regulatory Positioning
- Strengthened language in “Risks/Mitigations”: **“We will maintain a general wellness positioning, avoiding medical claims. Disclaimers included: ‘This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.’”**
- Clarified risk: Adaptive features are *supportive wellness insights*, not medical advice.

---

### 6. Non-CGM User Pathway
**Addition (Roadmap section):** “Phase 1 also accommodates non-CGM users through manual glucose logging or proxies (e.g., meal timing, RPE). Ensures value for users without CGM access.”

---

### 7. Community Support
**Addition (Personas & Brand slides):** Explicit mention of “community challenges and coach Q&A to boost motivation and adherence, especially for PCOS and pre-diabetic users.”

---

## Summary of Document Status

- Adoption trends nuanced: registry vs. population clarified.
- Personas strengthened with prevalence stats.
- KPIs reframed as aspirational with benchmarks cited.
- Regulatory safe harbor language tightened.
- Roadmap and community support updated for inclusivity and adherence.
