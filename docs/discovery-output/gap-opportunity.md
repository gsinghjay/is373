# Customer Discovery — Gap Analysis → Opportunity (Draft)

## Underserved Segments
- T1D lifters needing safety‑aware strength plans (in‑session rules)
- T2D adults needing low‑friction plans with low‑glycemic meals
- Pre‑diabetics wanting habit coaching that avoids overwhelm
- Women with PCOS/IR wanting PCOS‑friendly strength and stable energy

## Missing/Underused Persuasion Levers
- Unity (identity: diabetic athletes; PCOS‑friendly strength)
- Consistency (micro‑commitments; streaks)
- Authority (safety rules; advisors)
- Post‑purchase community emphasis

## Weak Funnel Stages
- MOFU: educational assets explaining safety logic and method
- BOFU: proof/testimonials specific to diabetes/IR use‑cases
- Post‑purchase: onboarding to reduce risk and increase adherence
- Evidence: [TODO links from content audit]

## Opportunity Statement
For active adults with diabetes or insulin resistance, we will provide safe, consistent progress by adapting workouts and low‑glycemic meals to daily glucose/metabolic context, unlike fitness apps that ignore glucose and tracking apps that stop at logging.

## Option Shortlist + ICE Scoring
| Option | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| T1D lifter wedge (strength) | 4 | 4 | 3 | 48 |
| T2D weight‑loss + cardio wedge | 4 | 3 | 4 | 48 |
| PCOS/IR “friendly strength” wedge | 4 | 3 | 3 | 36 |
| Coach B2B dashboard | 3 | 2 | 2 | 12 |
- Notes: Start with T1D lifter and PCOS/IR wedges for clear pain and community.

## Chosen Opportunity & Rationale
- Selected: T1D lifter + PCOS/IR wedges (parallel content tracks)
- Why: High pain/urgency; distinct content niches; strong community identity
- Risks: Regulatory ambiguity → wellness positioning; integration access → HealthKit/Google Fit first
