Introduction
------------

In entrepreneurship, theÂ **Customer Discovery Process**Â is the first step in theÂ **Lean Startup Methodology**Â (Steve Blank, Eric Ries).

-   Instead of building something first and hoping people like it, customer discovery means:

    1.  Studying your audience and competitors.

    2.  Identifying needs, motivations, and gaps.

    3.  Testing an opportunity before investing resources.

This assignment applies those ideas to yourÂ **media bubble**Â --- the topics, influencers, brands, and content that constantly appear on your social feeds.

You'll analyze the competitive landscape, reverse-engineer persuasion tactics and sales funnels, then propose aÂ **Brand Brief**,Â **Persona**, andÂ **Customer Journey**Â that fills a market gap. The final output will be aÂ **PowerPoint deck**Â that tells the story of your discovery process.

Background Concepts (Key Jargon Explained)
------------------------------------------

### Media Bubble

Your "media bubble" is the set of topics, accounts, and conversations you see regularly online because of your personal interests, algorithms, and network. Examples: fitness reels, crypto influencers, travel vlogs, beauty TikTok, climate activism, gaming Discords.

### Brand Archetypes

Based on Carl Jung's psychology, archetypes are universal characters that brands adopt to connect emotionally. Examples:

-   **Hero:**Â inspires achievement (Nike)

-   **Explorer:**Â freedom and discovery (North Face)

-   **Caregiver:**Â nurturing and service (Johnson & Johnson)

-   **Rebel:**Â challenges the system (Harley-Davidson)\
    *(Full list provided later for quick reference.)*

### Cialdini's 7 Principles of Persuasion

Dr. Robert Cialdini identified methods brands use to influence behavior:

-   **Reciprocity:**Â give value first (freebies, trials).

-   **Scarcity:**Â limited time or supply.

-   **Authority:**Â credentials, expertise.

-   **Consistency:**Â small commitments â†’ bigger commitments.

-   **Liking:**Â friendly, relatable personality.

-   **Social Proof:**Â reviews, testimonials, followers.

-   **Unity:**Â identity and belonging ("people like us").

### Long Tail / Niche

Chris Anderson's "long tail" concept shows that niche products with small but loyal audiences add up to big opportunities online. Instead of competing with mass-market players, you focus on a specific segment or subculture.

### Sales Funnel / Customer Journey

The step-by-step path fromÂ **awareness**Â â†’Â **interest**Â â†’Â **decision**Â â†’Â **purchase**Â â†’Â **loyalty/referral**.

-   **TOFU (Top of Funnel):**Â grabbing attention (short videos, memes, ads).

-   **MOFU (Middle of Funnel):**Â nurturing interest (emails, free guides, webinars).

-   **BOFU (Bottom of Funnel):**Â closing the sale (offers, testimonials, urgency).

-   **Post-Purchase:**Â onboarding, community, upsells, referrals.

### Persona

A semi-fictional profile of yourÂ **typical customer**, based on goals, pains, desires, objections, and buying triggers. Personas help you design content and funnels around real human needs.

### Brand Brief

A 1-page strategic document describing:

-   Archetype

-   Value Proposition

-   Positioning

-   Key Persuasion Levers

-   Content Niche

-   Offers & Differentiators
