This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

# analyst

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md → .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

  whenToUse: Use for workflow coordination, multi-agent tasks, role switching guidance, and when unsure which specialist to consult
persona:
  role: Master Orchestrator & BMad Method Expert
  style: Knowledgeable, guiding, adaptable, efficient, encouraging, technically brilliant yet approachable. Helps customize and use BMad Method while orchestrating agents
  identity: Unified interface to all BMad-Method capabilities, dynamically transforms into any specialized agent
  focus: Orchestrating the right agent/capability for each need, loading resources only when needed
  core_principles:
    - Become any agent on demand, loading files only when needed
    - Never pre-load resources - discover and load at runtime
    - Assess needs and recommend best approach/agent/workflow
    - Track current state and guide to next logical steps
    - When embodied, specialized persona's principles take precedence
    - Be explicit about active persona and current task
    - Always use numbered lists for choices
    - Process commands starting with * immediately
    - Always remind users that commands require * prefix

  === BMad Orchestrator Commands ===
  All commands must start with * (asterisk)

  Core Commands:
  *help ............... Show this guide
  *chat-mode .......... Start conversational mode for detailed assistance
  *kb-mode ............ Load full BMad knowledge base
  *status ............. Show current context, active agent, and progress
  *exit ............... Return to BMad or exit session

  Agent & Task Management:
  *agent [name] ....... Transform into specialized agent (list if no name)
  *task [name] ........ Run specific task (list if no name, requires agent)
  *checklist [name] ... Execute checklist (list if no name, requires agent)

  Workflow Commands:
  *workflow [name] .... Start specific workflow (list if no name)
  *workflow-guidance .. Get personalized help selecting the right workflow
  *plan ............... Create detailed workflow plan before starting
  *plan-status ........ Show current workflow plan progress
  *plan-update ........ Update workflow plan status

  Other Commands:
  *yolo ............... Toggle skip confirmations mode
  *party-mode ......... Group chat with all agents
  *doc-out ............ Output full document

  === Available Specialist Agents ===
  [Dynamically list each agent in bundle with format:
  *agent {id}: {title}
    When to use: {whenToUse}
    Key deliverables: {main outputs/documents}]

  === Available Workflows ===
  [Dynamically list each workflow in bundle with format:
  *workflow {id}: {name}
    Purpose: {description}]

  💡 Tip: Each agent has unique tasks, templates, and checklists. Switch to an agent to access their capabilities!

fuzzy-matching:
  - 85% confidence threshold
  - Show numbered list if unsure
transformation:
  - Match name/role to agents
  - Announce transformation
  - Operate until exit
loading:
  - KB: Only for *kb-mode or BMad questions
  - Agents: Only when transforming
  - Templates/Tasks: Only when executing
  - Always indicate loading
kb-mode-behavior:
  - When *kb-mode is invoked, use kb-mode-interaction task
  - Don't dump all KB content immediately
  - Present topic areas and wait for user selection
  - Provide focused, contextual responses
workflow-guidance:
  - Discover available workflows in the bundle at runtime
  - Understand each workflow's purpose, options, and decision points
  - Ask clarifying questions based on the workflow's structure
  - Guide users through workflow selection when multiple options exist
  - When appropriate, suggest: 'Would you like me to create a detailed workflow plan before starting?'
  - For workflows with divergent paths, help users choose the right path
  - Adapt questions to the specific domain (e.g., game dev vs infrastructure vs web dev)
  - Only recommend workflows that actually exist in the current bundle
  - When *workflow-guidance is called, start an interactive session and list all available workflows with brief descriptions
dependencies:
  data:
    - bmad-kb.md

REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - CRITICAL: Read the following full files as these are your explicit rules for development standards for this project - .bmad-core/core-config.yaml devLoadAlwaysFiles list
  - CRITICAL: Do NOT load any other files during startup aside from the assigned story and devLoadAlwaysFiles items, unless user requested you do or the following contradicts
  - CRITICAL: Do NOT begin development until a story is not in draft mode and you are told to proceed
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

  identity: Expert who implements stories by reading requirements and executing tasks sequentially with comprehensive testing
  focus: Executing story tasks with precision, updating Dev Agent Record sections only, maintaining minimal context overhead

  - CRITICAL: ALWAYS check current folder structure before starting your story tasks, don't create new working directory if it already exists. Create new one when you're sure it's a brand new project.
  - CRITICAL: ONLY update story file Dev Agent Record sections (checkboxes/Debug Log/Completion Notes/Change Log)
  - CRITICAL: FOLLOW THE develop-story command when the user tells you to implement the story
  - Numbered Options - Always use numbered lists when presenting choices to the user

# All commands require * prefix when used (e.g., *help)
commands:
  - help: Show numbered list of the following commands to allow selection
  - develop-story:
      - order-of-execution: 'Read (first or next) task→Implement Task and its subtasks→Write tests→Execute validations→Only if ALL pass, then update the task checkbox with [x]→Update story section File List to ensure it lists and new or modified or deleted source file→repeat order-of-execution until complete'
      - story-file-updates-ONLY:
          - CRITICAL: ONLY UPDATE THE STORY FILE WITH UPDATES TO SECTIONS INDICATED BELOW. DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER SECTIONS.
          - CRITICAL: You are ONLY authorized to edit these specific sections of story files - Tasks / Subtasks Checkboxes, Dev Agent Record section and all its subsections, Agent Model Used, Debug Log References, Completion Notes List, File List, Change Log, Status
          - CRITICAL: DO NOT modify Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Dev Notes, Testing sections, or any other sections not listed above
      - blocking: 'HALT for: Unapproved deps needed, confirm with user | Ambiguous after story check | 3 failures attempting to implement or fix something repeatedly | Missing config | Failing regression'
      - ready-for-review: 'Code matches requirements + All validations pass + Follows standards + File List complete'
      - completion: "All Tasks and Subtasks marked [x] and have tests→Validations and full regression passes (DON'T BE LAZY, EXECUTE ALL TESTS and CONFIRM)→Ensure File List is Complete→run the task execute-checklist for the checklist story-dod-checklist→set story status: 'Ready for Review'→HALT"
  - explain: teach me what and why you did whatever you just did in detail so I can learn. Explain to me as if you were training a junior engineer.
  - review-qa: run task `apply-qa-fixes.md'
  - run-tests: Execute linting and tests
  - exit: Say goodbye as the Developer, and then abandon inhabiting this persona

# Google Slides Generator — How To Use

This folder contains a Google Apps Script to generate the Customer Discovery deck.

## What You Get
- A Slides deck with the 10–12 slide outline pre‑created:
  - Title & media‑bubble evidence (drop‑zone)
  - Condensed competitor table
  - Content audit highlights
  - Gap → Opportunity
  - Brand brief snapshot
  - Persona (PCOS/IR)
  - Journey (TOFU→MOFU→BOFU→Post)
  - KPIs 30/60/90
  - Closing takeaway
  - Optional: Risks & Mitigations, Experiment Backlog
  - Sources

## Steps
1) Open Google Drive → New → More → Google Apps Script
2) Copy the contents of docs/discovery-output/gslides/create_deck.gs into the editor (replace any starter code)
3) File → Save (name it e.g. DiscoveryDeckGenerator)
4) Run ▶ createDiscoveryDeck
   - Approve permissions when prompted (Slides access)
5) Check the execution logs for the deck URL, or open Slides → Recent

## Customization
- Edit the content in getDeckContent() inside create_deck.gs to adjust titles, bullets, table rows.
- Replace placeholders with your competitor set and add links/screenshots.
- The title slide includes a drop‑zone rectangle; drag images there.

## Tips
- After generating, switch theme in Slides to match your brand.
- Keep the deck in sync with the source docs in docs/discovery-output/.

## Auto‑Fill From Repo (Recommended)
1) Generate content JSON locally:
   - Run: Wrote docs/discovery-output/gslides/content.json with 12 slides
   - Output: docs/discovery-output/gslides/content.json
2) Push the repo to GitHub (public or accessible)
3) In create_deck.gs,  is pre-set to:
   - 
   - If your default branch is not , change  to your branch.
4) Re‑run  — it will fetch and use the JSON for slides

Fallback: If not public yet, open , copy its JSON, and replace the return of  with that object.

# Customer Discovery — Gap Analysis → Opportunity (Draft)

## Underserved Segments
- T1D lifters needing safety‑aware strength plans (in‑session rules)
- T2D adults needing low‑friction plans with low‑glycemic meals
- Pre‑diabetics wanting habit coaching that avoids overwhelm
- Women with PCOS/IR wanting PCOS‑friendly strength and stable energy

## Missing/Underused Persuasion Levers
- Unity (identity: diabetic athletes; PCOS‑friendly strength)
- Consistency (micro‑commitments; streaks)
- Authority (safety rules; advisors)
- Post‑purchase community emphasis

## Weak Funnel Stages
- MOFU: educational assets explaining safety logic and method
- BOFU: proof/testimonials specific to diabetes/IR use‑cases
- Post‑purchase: onboarding to reduce risk and increase adherence
- Evidence: [TODO links from content audit]

## Opportunity Statement
For active adults with diabetes or insulin resistance, we will provide safe, consistent progress by adapting workouts and low‑glycemic meals to daily glucose/metabolic context, unlike fitness apps that ignore glucose and tracking apps that stop at logging.

## Option Shortlist + ICE Scoring
| Option | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| T1D lifter wedge (strength) | 4 | 4 | 3 | 48 |
| T2D weight‑loss + cardio wedge | 4 | 3 | 4 | 48 |
| PCOS/IR “friendly strength” wedge | 4 | 3 | 3 | 36 |
| Coach B2B dashboard | 3 | 2 | 2 | 12 |
- Notes: Start with T1D lifter and PCOS/IR wedges for clear pain and community.

## Chosen Opportunity & Rationale
- Selected: T1D lifter + PCOS/IR wedges (parallel content tracks)
- Why: High pain/urgency; distinct content niches; strong community identity
- Risks: Regulatory ambiguity → wellness positioning; integration access → HealthKit/Google Fit first

In entrepreneurship, the **Customer Discovery Process** is the first step in the **Lean Startup Methodology** (Steve Blank, Eric Ries).

-   Instead of building something first and hoping people like it, customer discovery means:

    1.  Studying your audience and competitors.

    2.  Identifying needs, motivations, and gaps.

    3.  Testing an opportunity before investing resources.

This assignment applies those ideas to your **media bubble** --- the topics, influencers, brands, and content that constantly appear on your social feeds.

You'll analyze the competitive landscape, reverse-engineer persuasion tactics and sales funnels, then propose a **Brand Brief**, **Persona**, and **Customer Journey** that fills a market gap. The final output will be a **PowerPoint deck** that tells the story of your discovery process.

* * * * *

Background Concepts (Key Jargon Explained)
------------------------------------------

### Media Bubble

Your "media bubble" is the set of topics, accounts, and conversations you see regularly online because of your personal interests, algorithms, and network. Examples: fitness reels, crypto influencers, travel vlogs, beauty TikTok, climate activism, gaming Discords.

### Brand Archetypes

Based on Carl Jung's psychology, archetypes are universal characters that brands adopt to connect emotionally. Examples:

-   **Hero:** inspires achievement (Nike)

-   **Explorer:** freedom and discovery (North Face)

-   **Caregiver:** nurturing and service (Johnson & Johnson)

-   **Rebel:** challenges the system (Harley-Davidson)\
    *(Full list provided later for quick reference.)*

### Cialdini's 7 Principles of Persuasion

Dr. Robert Cialdini identified methods brands use to influence behavior:

-   **Reciprocity:** give value first (freebies, trials).

-   **Scarcity:** limited time or supply.

-   **Authority:** credentials, expertise.

-   **Consistency:** small commitments → bigger commitments.

-   **Liking:** friendly, relatable personality.

-   **Social Proof:** reviews, testimonials, followers.

-   **Unity:** identity and belonging ("people like us").

### Long Tail / Niche

Chris Anderson's "long tail" concept shows that niche products with small but loyal audiences add up to big opportunities online. Instead of competing with mass-market players, you focus on a specific segment or subculture.

### Sales Funnel / Customer Journey

The step-by-step path from **awareness** → **interest** → **decision** → **purchase** → **loyalty/referral**.

-   **TOFU (Top of Funnel):** grabbing attention (short videos, memes, ads).

-   **MOFU (Middle of Funnel):** nurturing interest (emails, free guides, webinars).

-   **BOFU (Bottom of Funnel):** closing the sale (offers, testimonials, urgency).

-   **Post-Purchase:** onboarding, community, upsells, referrals.

### Persona

A semi-fictional profile of your **typical customer**, based on goals, pains, desires, objections, and buying triggers. Personas help you design content and funnels around real human needs.

### Brand Brief

A 1-page strategic document describing:

-   Archetype

-   Value Proposition

-   Positioning

-   Key Persuasion Levers

-   Content Niche

-   Offers & Differentiators

* * * * *

Assignment Instructions
-----------------------

### Step 1: Choose Your Topic (Media Bubble)

Template: templates/customer-discovery/01-topic-media-bubble-template.md

Pick something you see a lot in your feed (fitness, gaming, skincare, politics, memes, etc.). Provide screenshots/links showing it's part of your personal bubble.

* * * * *

### Step 2: Competitive Landscape (3--5 Competitors)

Template: templates/customer-discovery/02-competitive-landscape-template.md

For each competitor, analyze:

-   **Archetype** -- Which brand archetype do they embody?

-   **Persuasion Methods** -- Which of Cialdini's principles are used?

-   **Content Niche** -- What subtopic or audience do they own?

-   **Sales Funnel / Customer Journey** -- What path do they push audiences through (TOFU → MOFU → BOFU → Post-Purchase)?

📊 Deliverable: **Landscape Table** (one row per competitor).

* * * * *

### Step 2.5 (Optional but Recommended): Content Audit / Engagement

Template: templates/customer-discovery/02-5-content-audit-template.md

Choose 2--3 posts from each competitor. Record:

-   Format & style (short/long form, tone).

-   Engagement signals (likes, comments, saves).

-   Call-to-action (where they send users in the funnel).

This helps you evaluate not just tactics, but effectiveness.

* * * * *

### Step 3: Gap Analysis → Opportunity

Template: templates/customer-discovery/03-gap-analysis-opportunity-template.md

From your research, identify what's missing:

-   Who's underserved?

-   What archetype or persuasion lever isn't being used?

-   Which funnel stages are weak?

**Write a 1-sentence Opportunity Statement:**

> *"For [audience], we will [deliver value] by [approach], unlike [competitors] who [limitation]."*

* * * * *

### Step 4: Brand Brief

Template: templates/customer-discovery/04-brand-brief-template.md

Summarize your new idea. Include:

-   Working Name

-   Archetype (and why)

-   Value Proposition (clear outcome for customer)

-   Positioning Statement

-   Persuasion Levers you'll emphasize

-   Content Niche (topic, format, platform)

-   Core Offers (free → entry → flagship → upsell/community)

-   Differentiators (3 bullets)

-   Success Metrics

* * * * *

### Step 5: Persona (Typical Customer)

Template: templates/customer-discovery/05-persona-template.md

Build a one-page profile:

-   Name & Demographics

-   Jobs-To-Be-Done (tasks/outcomes they want)

-   Pains/Fears

-   Gains/Desired Outcomes

-   Objections

-   Buying Triggers

-   Where They Live Online

-   What Proof They Need to Believe

* * * * *

### Step 6: Customer Journey / Sales Funnel (for your idea)

Template: templates/customer-discovery/06-customer-journey-funnel-template.md

Map your funnel end-to-end:

-   **TOFU:** Awareness content & hooks

-   **MOFU:** Lead magnet & nurturing assets

-   **BOFU:** Offer, landing page, testimonials

-   **Post-Purchase:** Onboarding, community, upsells, referrals

📊 Deliverable: Diagram or bullet flow.

* * * * *

Final Deliverable: PowerPoint Deck

Presentation template: templates/customer-discovery/08-presentation-outline-template.md  
Success metrics template: templates/customer-discovery/07-success-metrics-kpis-template.md
----------------------------------

**Slide Outline (10--12 slides):**

1.  Title & Topic (your media bubble evidence)

2.  Competitive Landscape Table (3--5 competitors)

3.  Content Audit Highlights (best/worst performing posts)

4.  Gap Analysis (bullets)

5.  Opportunity Statement

6.  Brand Brief (visualized)

7.  Persona (profile slide)

8.  Customer Journey Map (diagram)

9.  Success Metrics & KPIs

10. Closing Takeaway

* * * * *

Grading Rubric (100 pts)
------------------------

-   **Competitive Landscape (30 pts)** -- depth of analysis, clarity of archetype/persuasion/funnel

-   **Gap Analysis & Opportunity (15 pts)** -- originality and defensibility

-   **Brand Brief (20 pts)** -- clear, concise, strategic

# RangeFit — Customer Discovery and BRD

RangeFit explores an AI fitness coach for people with diabetes (T1D/T2D), pre-diabetics, and women with insulin resistance/PCOS. The product goal is safe, consistent training with daily clarity. This repo contains the BRD, customer-discovery templates, filled drafts, and a Google Slides generator for the presentation deck.

Important: This project is wellness/fitness guidance only. It does not diagnose, treat, or provide medical advice. No dosing instructions or clinical claims.

## What’s Inside
- BRD: docs/brd.md
- Customer-Discovery Guide + Templates: docs/customer-discovery-process.md, docs/templates/customer-discovery/*.md
- Discovery Outputs (drafts ready for evidence): docs/discovery-output/
  - Brand brief: docs/discovery-output/brand-brief.md
  - Personas: docs/discovery-output/personas-{t1d,t2d,pre,pcos}.md
  - Landscape & Content Audit: docs/discovery-output/{landscape,content-audit}.md
  - Gap → Opportunity: docs/discovery-output/gap-opportunity.md
  - Journey/Funnel: docs/discovery-output/journey.md
  - KPIs (30/60/90): docs/discovery-output/kpis-30-60-90.md
  - Deck outline: docs/discovery-output/deck-outline.md
  - Google Slides generator: docs/discovery-output/gslides/*
- Script to compile deck content JSON: scripts/generate-gslides-content.mjs

## Quick Start
- Read the BRD at docs/brd.md.
- Follow the discovery guide docs/customer-discovery-process.md and collect evidence (screenshots/links) for:
  - Media bubble examples (Slide 1)
  - 2–3 posts per competitor (Content Audit)
- Fill the discovery drafts under docs/discovery-output/ as you gather evidence.

## Generate the Google Slides Deck
Two options are supported.

- Option A — Auto-fill from repo (recommended)
  1. Generate content JSON locally
     - Run: node scripts/generate-gslides-content.mjs
     - Output: docs/discovery-output/gslides/content.json
  2. Push the repo to GitHub (public or accessible)
  3. Open docs/discovery-output/gslides/create_deck.gs and set:
     - CONFIG.contentUrl = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/docs/discovery-output/gslides/content.json
  4. Create a new Apps Script project in Google Drive and paste create_deck.gs, then run createDiscoveryDeck

- Option B — Manual paste
  1. Open docs/discovery-output/gslides/content.json
  2. Copy its JSON and replace the object returned by getDeckContent() in create_deck.gs
  3. Run createDiscoveryDeck

See docs/discovery-output/gslides/README.md for detailed steps.

## Deep Research Verification Workflow
Use this checklist to validate and strengthen the discovery artifacts.
- Competitive Landscape
  - Verify competitor set relevance (T1D/T2D/pre-diabetic/PCOS/IR niches)
  - Capture 2–3 posts per competitor with hooks, CTA, engagement (Content Audit)
- Gap → Opportunity
  - Validate underserved segments and persuasion/funnel gaps with evidence links
- Brand Brief
  - Confirm archetype blend (Caregiver + Hero/Sage), value prop clarity, differentiators
- Personas
  - Confirm JTBD, pains/gains, objections, triggers with source links or quotes
- Journey & KPIs
  - Ensure 30/60/90 targets align with BRD north stars and are measurable

Document supporting evidence inline using links and brief notes. Prefer primary sources (product pages, official channels, creator accounts) and recent content.

## Disclaimers & Safety
- Not a medical device; no diagnosis/treatment; no dosing guidance
- Position as wellness/fitness guidance with clear disclaimers
- If integrating with covered entities in future: BAA + HIPAA-aligned controls
- Data privacy: encryption at rest/in transit, least privilege, audit logs

## Contributing
- Use the templates under docs/templates/customer-discovery/ when adding new analyses
- Keep drafts in docs/discovery-output/ up to date with evidence screenshots/links
- When editing slides content, update docs/discovery-output/deck-outline.md then regenerate content.json via:
  - node scripts/generate-gslides-content.mjs

## Project Structure
- docs/ — BRD, guide, templates, outputs
- docs/discovery-output/ — Working drafts and deck outline
- docs/discovery-output/gslides/ — Apps Script + JSON for deck generation
- scripts/ — Local utilities (e.g., generate-gslides-content.mjs)

## Roadmap
- Expand competitor cards with quantified engagement metrics
- Add research log and citations file (optional) under docs/research/
- Add optional Google Slides theme configuration

- 1‑liner: CGM/IR‑aware AI fitness coach for T1D, T2D, pre‑diabetic, and PCOS/IR; one clear plan/day for safe, consistent progress.

## Archetype
- Primary archetype: Caregiver (safety, support) + Hero (achievement)
- Why: Users want progress without scary episodes; the brand must both protect and empower.

## Positioning Statement
For active adults with diabetes or insulin resistance who want to train safely and consistently, RangeFit is an AI fitness coach that adapts workouts and meals to real‑time glucose trends/variability and metabolic context. Unlike general fitness apps or diabetes loggers, we integrate device data and safety thresholds to drive plans and nudges, not just charts.

## Value Proposition
- Core outcomes:
  - T1D/T2D: safer training days, fewer symptomatic lows, one clear plan/day
  - Pre‑diabetic/IR/PCOS: stable energy, low‑glycemic meals, sustainable strength/weight progress
- Proof (non‑clinical): transparent safety logic; device integrations roadmap; testimonials; adherence metrics.

## Persuasion Levers (plan)
- Reciprocity: free “7‑day sugar‑safe plan” and “PCOS‑friendly strength + meals”
- Scarcity: early access to Pro features (when approved), limited cohort challenges
- Authority: advisory council; published safety guidelines; transparent logic
- Consistency: streaks, micro‑commitments, weekly wins
- Liking: authentic founder story; relatable voice
- Social Proof: athlete/client stories; community highlights
- Unity: “diabetic athletes” and “PCOS‑friendly strength” communities

## Content Niche & Distribution
- Niche: Sugar‑safe strength training; PCOS‑friendly training; fueling for workouts
- Platforms: TikTok/Shorts/IG → email → app
- Formats: short tips, checklists, transformations, explainers
- Cadence: daily shorts; weekly email

## Offer Ladder
| Tier | Name | Promise | Price | Format | Risk Reversal | CTA |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Free | 7‑day plans (T1D/PCOS variants) | Safe starts | 0 | PDF/email | No CC | Get plan |
| Entry | Premium | Device‑synced daily plan | 14.99/mo | App | 14‑day trial | Start trial |
| Flagship | Pro | Direct CGM, alerts, insights | 24.99/mo | App | Early access slots | Join Pro |
| Community | Challenges/Coach Chat | Accountability, progression |  | In‑app | Satisfaction pledge | Join |

## Differentiators (3)
- CGM‑aware periodization and in‑session safety rules
- IR/PCOS‑friendly defaults and meal templates (no medical claims)
- Daily clarity (one plan/day) with adaptive nudges

## Success Metrics (initial)
- Awareness: VTR, CTR to LP
- Consideration: lead magnet opt‑ins, email CTR
- Conversion: trial starts, LP CVR, trial→paid
- Post‑purchase: D1/D7/D30 retention, plan adherence ≥ 60%, NPS

## Regulatory & Safety Notes
- Product is positioned as a general wellness/fitness guidance tool — no diagnosis/treatment claims; no dosing instructions.
- Messaging emphasizes education and user‑directed choices (e.g., “learn to train safely,” not “treat/improve disease”).
- FDA enforcement context: See Whoop warning letter analysis (2025) for boundary examples — https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2025/09/fda-warning-letter-to-fitness-wearable-sponsor
- Dexcom exercise tips illustrate data‑driven user decisions (not prescriptive plans) — https://www.dexcom.com/en-us/all-access/managing-diabetes/exercise-tips-from-dietitian

# Customer Discovery — Presentation Deck Outline (Draft)

Reference templates: docs/templates/customer-discovery/08-presentation-outline-template.md

## Slide 1 — Title & Topic
- Headline: RangeFit — Safety‑Aware AI Coaching for Diabetes & PCOS/IR
- Subhead: Media bubble shows diabetic athletes, CGM training tips, PCOS‑friendly strength, and IR‑friendly meals with strong engagement
- Assets: [Add 3–5 screenshots/links from TikTok/YouTube/IG/Reddit]
- Takeaway: Large, engaged niches lack CGM/IR‑aware strength coaching with simple daily guidance

## Slide 2 — Competitive Landscape Table (Condensed)
- Headline: Plans vs. Data — No One Bridges Safety‑Aware Training

| Competitor | Niche | Primary Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Fitbod | Strength planner | No glucose/IR context |
| Freeletics | AI coach | Not diabetes‑aware |
| MySugr | Diabetes logger | No prescriptive training |
| Dexcom/LibreView | Device ecosystem | Not prescriptive |
| Supersapiens/Levels | Metabolic insights | Limited prescriptive workouts/strength |

- Takeaway: Fitness excels at plans; diabetes/metabolic excels at data; neither delivers CGM/IR‑aware strength periodization

## Slide 3 — Content Audit Highlights
- Headline: Hooks and CTAs That Land (and Miss)
- Best examples (2–3): [Add links/screens]
- What worked: clear transformations, simple checklists, authentic voice
- What didn’t: generic nutrition claims, dense charts without action
- Takeaway: Short, specific, safety‑oriented tips outperform broad claims

## Slide 4 — Gap Analysis
- Headline: Underserved Segments + Weak Stages
- Underserved: T1D lifters; T2D adults; pre‑diabetics; women with PCOS/IR
- Weak stages: MOFU education on safety logic; BOFU proof/testimonials; Post‑purchase onboarding/community
- Takeaway: A safety‑aware, PCOS/IR‑friendly strength wedge is open

## Slide 5 — Opportunity Statement
- Headline: One‑Sentence Opportunity
- Statement: For active adults with diabetes or insulin resistance, we will provide safe, consistent progress by adapting workouts and low‑glycemic meals to daily glucose/metabolic context, unlike fitness apps that ignore glucose and tracking apps that stop at logging.
 - Why now: CGM adoption (U.S. T1D Exchange registry ~95% CGM use in 2025; 2022 multicenter data show higher youth vs. lower adult CGM use); short‑form fitness education; AI personalization expectations

## Slide 6 — Brand Brief (Visual)
- Headline: Caregiver + Hero Archetype; Clear Outcomes
- Archetype/Positioning/Value prop: Safety‑aware strength and IR‑friendly meals; one plan/day; fewer scary episodes; steady energy
- Persuasion levers: Authority, Consistency, Unity, Reciprocity, Social Proof, Liking
- Differentiators: CGM‑aware periodization; PCOS/IR defaults; daily clarity with adaptive nudges

## Slide 7 — Persona (Profile)
- Headline: PCOS/IR “Maya” (32) — Sustainable Strength, Stable Energy
- Snapshot: Bio, JTBD, pains (energy dips, conflicting advice), gains (steady progress, confidence), proof needed (simple rules, success stories)
- Link: docs/discovery-output/personas-pcos.md

## Slide 8 — Customer Journey Map
- Headline: TOFU → MOFU → BOFU → Post
- TOFU: Shorts with sugar‑safe/PCOS‑friendly tips → CTA: free 7‑day plan
- MOFU: Lead magnet + 5‑email method explainer → CTA: 14‑day trial
- BOFU: Offer page with safety logic + testimonials → CTA: Start trial
- Post: Onboarding to daily plan; community challenges; Pro upsell when eligible
- Link: docs/discovery-output/journey.md

## Slide 9 — Success Metrics & KPIs
- Headline: 30/60/90 Targets Aligned to BRD
- Awareness: CTR to LP 2%/3%/4%
- Consideration: Opt‑ins 25%/30%/35%; email CTR 8%/10%/12%
- Conversion: LP CVR 6%/8%/10%; trial→paid 7%/9%/12%
- Post‑purchase: D1/D7/D30 near 55/30/15 (ambitious); plan adherence ≥ 60% (aspirational)
- Link: docs/discovery-output/kpis-30-60-90.md

## Slide 10 — Closing Takeaway
- Headline: Wedge First, Then Expand
- The bet: Win T1D lifter and PCOS/IR wedges with safety‑aware strength → expand into broader segments as integrations mature
- Next steps: Evidence capture, competitor cards, lead magnet build, tracking plan

## Optional Slide 11 — Risks & Mitigations
- Regulatory ambiguity → wellness positioning; no clinical claims; disclaimers
- Device access → HealthKit/Google Fit first; apply to Dexcom/Abbott
- Privacy/security → SOC2 path; HIPAA‑aligned controls where appropriate

## Optional Slide 12 — Experiment Backlog
- LP A/B (safety logic explainer)
- Lead magnet variants (T1D vs. PCOS)
- Email sequence tests (order, proof density)
- TOFU hooks (checklist vs. transformation)

## BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (BRD)

### 1) Problem Statement
People with diabetes (Type 1 & Type 2) want to train, lose fat, and gain muscle **safely**. Generic fitness apps ignore glucose trends, while many diabetes apps don’t translate data into actionable training and nutrition plans. Users need a **single place** that:
- Ingests CGM and activity data
- Interprets it in real time
- Produces **personalized** workouts, meals, and safety nudges

### 2) Goals
**Primary**
- Increase user time-in-range (TIR) during training days
- Improve workout adherence and consistency
- Deliver high-retention subscription revenue via AI coaching

**Secondary**
- Generate longitudinal insights (patterns across training, meals, sleep)
- Create a community loop for accountability and retention

### 3) Non‑Goals
- We are **not** a medical device. We do not diagnose, treat, or provide medical advice.  
- We will not replace clinicians or insulin dosing decisions.

### 4) Target Users & Personas
- **T1D Lifter “Alex” (Age 20–40):** Uses CGM/pump, trains 3–5x/week, wants body recomposition without hypos.
- **T2D Rebuilder “Sam” (Age 30–60):** Uses CGM or fingersticks; wants weight loss, cardio habit, and sustainable meals.
- **Pre‑diabetic “Jordan” (Age 25–55):** Wants to prevent progression; prefers habit coaching.
- **Women with PCOS/Insulin Resistance “Maya” (Age 20–45):** Seeks sustainable weight loss and strength with stable energy; may use CGM, fingersticks, or none. Wants low‑glycemic meals, safety‑aware workouts, and clear daily guidance without medical advice.
- **Coach “Riley”:** Wants dashboards for 5–50 clients (future B2B).

### 5) Value Proposition
- **Safety‑aware training**: AI adjusts intensity based on glucose trend & variability
- **Nutrition that fits the moment**: meals and timing that reflect real‑time glucose state
- **Daily clarity**: one plan per day, zero guesswork
- **Metabolic‑aware guidance**: adapts training and meals for insulin resistance and, when relevant, cycle context — strictly within wellness/fitness (no medical claims).

### 6) Competitive Landscape (high level)
- Fitness planning apps (Fitbod, Freeletics, Centr): great workouts, **no glucose context**
- Diabetes loggers (Dexcom, LibreView, MySugr): rich data, **limited fitness coaching**
- General AI coaches: broad scope, **no CGM‑aware periodization**

### 7) Success Metrics (North Stars)
**Product**
- D1 retention ≥ 55%, D7 ≥ 30%, D30 ≥ 15%
- Weekly Active Users (WAU/MAU) ≥ 0.5
- Plan adherence (workout or meal task completed) ≥ 60% weekly
- Avg. push notification CTR ≥ 18%

**Health‑adjacent (non‑clinical)**
- Avg. training‑day TIR +5–10% vs. user baseline (self‑reported/connected data)
- ↓ symptomatic lows during/after workouts (self‑report)
- Self‑reported post‑meal energy stability on training days (PCOS/IR cohort)
- Weekly plan adherence for PCOS/IR‑friendly meals/workouts ≥ 60%

**Business**
- Trial → paid conversion ≥ 7–12%
- Monthly churn ≤ 6–8%
- ARPU (paid) ≥ $14.99

### 8) Pricing & Packaging
- **Free**: basic plan generator (no device sync), community challenges
- **Premium $14.99/mo or $99/yr**: device sync via HealthKit/Google Fit, AI daily plan, macros, habit loops
- **Pro $24.99/mo or $159/yr**: direct CGM integrations (Dexcom/Libre when approved), advanced insights, coach chat, safety alerts

### 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **Regulatory ambiguity** (fitness vs. medical):
  - Strong disclaimers; position as **wellness/fitness guidance**
  - Avoid dosing instructions, diagnostic claims
  - Avoid clinical/therapeutic claims for PCOS/IR; position as wellness guidance only; no diagnosis/treatment
  - If partnering with covered entities, pursue **BAA** and HIPAA controls
- **Data privacy/security**:
  - SOC2 path; HIPAA‑aligned controls where appropriate
  - Encryption at rest+in transit, least‑privilege, audit logs
- **Device API access**:
  - Start with **Apple HealthKit/Google Fit**; then apply for Dexcom/Abbott programs
- **User safety (hypos/hypers)**:
  - Clear thresholds, alerts, and “pause workout” recommendations

### 10) Go‑To‑Market
- Founder story (diabetes + fitness) via TikTok/Shorts/Twitter/Reddit
- Partnerships with diabetes creators & gyms
- Employer wellness pilots (phase 2)
- Community challenges (streaks, leaderboards)
